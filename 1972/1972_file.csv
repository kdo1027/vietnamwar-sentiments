Those who came to maturity in the late forties and early fifties hardly think of themselves in terms of a coherent “generation.” Individually, they may feel guilty or lucky because they escaped the horror, but if they think of themselves as a group at all, they do not reach for labels like “tragic,” “heroic” or “lost.” They are a generation without a myth, without an event, without any picturesque image of themselves.

The Screen,1972-04-28,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/28/archives/the-screen.html,article,"Although its producer, David Gil, insists that ""Journey Through Rosebud"" is ""the first totally honest and objective portrait of the contemporary American Indian on film,"" it takes a great deal of wishful interpretation to avoid seeing the movie as an invasion—rather than as an illumination—of a social problem.The film, directed by Tom Gries (who once made a very good, very somber Western called ""Will Penny""), is as well-meaning and boob-brained as its hero, Danny (Kristoffer Tabori), a principled young draft-dodger whom we first see as he wanders lonely as a cloud across a hilltop singing ""America the Beautiful."" He doesn't actually wander. He struts (it seems as if he knows there's a camera near), and he throws up the movie's ironies like a bulldozer plowing through daffodils.Danny, who is looking for sanctuary, hitchhikes into Rosebud, the South Dakota Sioux reservation. He stays around to marvel at their rituals, including the kind of tribal dances that must always look picturesque to the outsider, and to sympathize with their frustrations as represented by Frank (Robert Forster), a young Sioux Vietnam veteran whose life has been pretty much reduced to beer drinking and small gestures of defiance towards the white sheriff and the Indian agent.After one arbitrary thing and another, Danny suddenly finds himself acting like a token offering, the feeble, unwitting victim of an assault that the movie seems to mean as a setting to rights of the massacre at Wounded Knee.Among the few unembarrassing things in the film is the performance by Mr. Forster (""Justine,"" ""Medium Cool""), who is such an easy, unaffected actor that he doesn't look out of place among the large number of real Indians who are in the supporting cast, and whom the camera treats as if they were holy relics. Victoria Racimo, who is pretty and looks faintly Eurasian, plays Forster's former wife, an Indian militant who is required to say things like ""I'm an Indian and I'm going to walk in beauty like the medicine men say.""It is, I suppose, as much a comment on the dopily earnest tone of the film itself, as on the state of socially conscious filmmaking, that much of ""Journey Through Rosebud"" sounds like a parody of Black Consciousness movies and television plays usually made by humorless whites.""Journey Through Rosebud,"" which opened yesterday at the Murray Hill, is described as the first motion picture to be made entirely on an Indian reservation. This information I will file with my list of other firsts, including the fact that Samuel Fuller's ""Hell and High Water"" was the first movie about a submarine ever photographed in Cinema-Scope. Contemporary Indians have been better treated by educational television in documentaries that may or may not have been filmed entirely on the reservation.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

But the Vietnam problem itself remains the same. There have always been only three possibilities. One is military victory. Our side can achieve it only through massacres and risks of international confrontation disproportionate to the importance of the stakes for America's national interest. The second is perpetual American involvement to preserve Saigon. This is bound to breed crisis after crisis indecisively. The third is a negotiated settlement, under our auspices or after our withdrawal.

Jane Fonda's 'F.T.A.' Show Now a Film,1972-07-22,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/22/archives/jane-fondas-fta-show-now-a-film.html,article,"By now most people must know something about the political vaudeville troupe formed by Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland and others to offer soldiers an alternate entertainment to say, Bob Hope, or whatever shows are provided by the U.S.O. The troupe called itself F.T.A., which stands for Free Theater Associates, or for other things such as, Free the Army.Last year, against considerable official opposition, it toured United States military bases in the Pacific. Francine Parker's ""F.T.A.,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Victoria theaters, is a documentary about aspects of that tour.The film divides its attention pretty evenly between the performers and their audience, and a lot of time is given to interviews with dissident, or merely disillusioned, servicemen. Some hate the war in Vietnam. Some just voice dismay at certain truths about the military like ""They don't want you to be an individual"") that have been perpetually rediscovered by raw recruits at least since the Battle of Thermopylae.So much time is given to the audience, whose insights, though real, are neither original nor profound, that the actual performance comes across in scattered bits and pieces.A lot of the show must have been very funny, with a kind of humor genuinely in touch with the desperation borne of simply being in the service. (Army doctor prescribing to obviously pregnant wife of enlisted man: ""Go home and take two A.P.C. tablets and come back when your swelling goes down."")But as presented in the movie, most of the show doesn't seem very funny, except inadvertently—as when Donald Sutherland seriously recites the prose of Dalton Trumbo with a straight-from-the-shoulder solemnity that happens to be perfectly in keeping with his phony-preacher characterization in Jules Feiffer's ""Little Murders.""Occasionally the F.T.A. troupe becomes involved with the local population, so that we may hear the Just Grievances Against American Imperialism of the people of Okinawa or Japan or wherever Miss Fonda and her colleagues happen to be listening. I found most of this a predictable bore, but it did allow for the film's only really striking sequence: an anti-American guerrilla theater pageant in the Philippines that momentarily turns revolutionary passion into a romantic gesture of extraordinary beauty.Otherwise there are a few good things. There is the lovely ballad singing of Rita Martinson (most of the singing, by Len Chandler, isn't so lovely), some hints at lively routines, an occasional glimpse of deep happiness in eyes of Miss Fonda or of Holly Near. But the spirit of F.T.A. must lie elsewhere, in other times and special places. For all its agility and pressing close-ups, the film doesn't capture that spirit—or even adequately show the kind of experience that might have let it grow.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

'The Visitors' Portrays Ordeal of a Threatened G.I.,1972-02-03,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/03/archives/the-visitors-portrays-ordeal-of-a-threatened-gi.html,article,"Elia Kazan's ""The Visitors,"" written by his eldest son, Chris Kazan, and shot in 16-mm, entirely in and around the Kazan country home in Newton, Conn., concerns the ordeal of Bill Schmidt (James Woods), an ex-G.I. who, with Martha (Patricia Joyce), the unwed mother of his baby, is threatened for 16 hours by two former buddies against whom the G.I. brought evidence of war crimes during their tour of duty in Vietnam.In the course of a routine patrol, the two former soldiers, along with other members of their squad, had first raped a young Vietnamese girl, who might possibly have been a Vietcong sympathizer, and then bayoneted her to death.It is one of the oddities of ""The Visitors,"" which is otherwise not exactly shy of exposition, that although Schmidt remains a shadowy character, the very fact that he can't explain why he turned in his two friends is one of the most interesting and meaningful aspects of the movie. It's as if it had been an unconscious impulse, a dim vestige of the kind of honor that today is as practical as an appendix.""The Visitors"" is a far from great film. It insists on saying too much about large issues when it should keep quiet and it's ambiguous when one has a right to expect explicit answers. Yet it is an extremely moving film, partly, I think, because everything—from the physical production to the melodrama—is kept in small scale, as if not to get in the way of, or to confuse, its very legitimate expression of a major American sorrow.I must emphasize, however, that I find ""The Visitors"" moving not only because I happen to share the Kazans' political and moral concerns. As anyone who squirmed through the idiocies of ""Johnny Got His Gun"" knows, the sharing of such concerns can often be a fate worse than death. Chris Kazan's screenplay sometimes has all of the grace of the Dalton Trumbo non-classic, especially in speeches that persist in spelling out simplistic points that, with any luck, we've already gotten.""The Visitors,"" however, is very much an Elia Kazan film and he is still a first-rate director, particularly of actors, in this case of four new young actors who possess the mystery and self-assurance of much more experienced performers. Especially effective is Steve Rails-back as the more murderous of the two visitors, a young man who looks like the sort of a nice, clean-cut, small-town American boy who could eat a piece of apple pie with one hand and cut a friend's throat with the other. However, I also liked Chico Martinez as the other visitor and both Miss Joyce and Mr. Woods, whose performances — mannerisms, movements, ways of touching each other—must supply explanations that Chris Kazan was apparently too busy to develop.The nominal star of the film is Patrick McVey as Miss Joyce's novelist-father, and it may be that my reaction to him is as much influenced by the unpleasant character he plays as by his performance, which does seem a bit broad even for a football-loving whisky-guzzling, right-wing fool. Says Miss Joyce at one point: ""My mother couldn't stand him—and neither could his other two wives.""For the most part, the elder Kazan keeps ""The Visitors"" remarkably unfancy and untricky. There is one almost nostalgic moment that recalls Mr. Kazan's best work of the 1950's, when, as in certain scenes in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""On the Waterfront,"" he employs highly theatrical melodrama—in this case, a scene in which Miss Joyce allows herself to be sexually drawn to one of the terrifying visitors—in such a way that the theatricality becomes real dramatic substance, and not a substitution for it.""The Visitors,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, repeatedly reminded me of Sam Peckinpah's more flamboyant ""Straw Dogs,"" and although I don't think it ranks higher in any appreciable respect, I'd much rather argue about it—what's right with it as well as what's wrong with it.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

"'Georgia, Georgia' Arrives at the Forum",1972-03-11,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/11/archives/georgia-georgia-arrives-at-the-forum.html,article,"Maya Angelou, the black-author-actress-singer-poet who is making her debut as a screenwriter, along with Diana Sands and the rest of the interracial cast of ""Georgia, Georgia,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum, cannot be faulted for lack of purpose and sincerity.They speak with passionate feeling about the stark state of blacks in a world of terrible misunderstanding and dissension. But their emotions are, sadly enough, too often projected in rhetoric and surface histrionics rather than drama.Miss Sands, in the role of an American pop singing star on a concert tour in Stockholm, is caught up in the genuine ecstacy of a love affair with a white, expatriate American photographer. She is also dependent on but dislikes her militantly black, mother-figure of a maid-companion and her homosexual, black manager. And she is constantly importuned by a group of black G.I. deserters from Vietnam who want her help in enlisting sympathy for them back home.These frighteningly real issues are couched in explicit, with-it dialogue, but they are for the most part merely stated, often stridently, and not resolved. Miss Angelou's unexpected, shocking climactic scene, involving Miss Sands and her companion, appears to be not so much of a resolution of the film or her tortured heroine's problems as simply a melodramatic device.Credit Miss Sands with a finely tuned performance as the troubled entertainer desperately seeking identity in her hectic surroundings. She may be, as one of the principals wrly says, a cool, superior type who has ""just about kicked the habit"" of being black.But she is also the lonely success who, detesting her companion, still needs in private her mammy-like lullabies and ministrations. And she is a woman suddenly and defiantly in love.Dirk Benedict, now on Broadway in ""Butterflies Are Free,"" makes his film debut with a sensitive, restrained performance as a young man in love. Minnie Gentry of Broadway's ""Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death"" is forcefully natural as the officious maid-companion consumed by hatred of whites.Along with other actual black deserters, Terry Whitmore, the G. I. subject of a 1969 documentary about his desertion, gives reality, though not much impact, to the proceedings. And Roger Furman, as the homosexual manager, gives a merely conventional performance.Stig Bjorkman, the film's young Swedish director, has competently kept the story and cast moving briskly against the colorful background of Stockholm, where the film was shot. But the basic, essentially important source material provided by Miss Angelou is too often simplistic and only occasionally memorable.",Review,A. H. WEILER,Archives,,[]

' Dynamite Chicken' Is Aimed at the Young,1972-01-04,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/04/archives/dynamite-chicken-is-aimed-at-the-young.html,article,"Having described ""Dynamite Chicken,"" which landed at the Kips Bay yesterday, as a ""multi-media movie magazine inspired by the TV generation,"" Ernie Pintoff, its producer-director, has almost said it all.In this case, the medium is mostly the message. But the medium blithely overlooks stressing the points of a good number of its messages in favor of a succession of kaleidoscopic glimpses of youth's apathy or revolt against the Establishment. Like its pertinent four letter words and nudes, ""Dynamite Chicken"" may be fun and games on occasion but it's hardly a shocking revelation these days.Since it was aimed at the college circuits, where it has been shown for some time, ""Dynamite Chicken"" briefly employs the talents of practically everyone adored by the campus crowd, from Joan Baez to Andy Warhol, in skits, songs and on its sound track. And Mr. Pintoff, who's kidded our foibles in cartoons (the Oscar-winning ""The Critic"") on TV and on film, has been aided by a legion of filmmakers and entertainers in fashioning this ""contemporary probe of the mores and manners of the revolutionary era and a lot of other things.""But ""Dynamite Chicken"" often appears to be a lot of other things. The Ace Trucking Company, for example, projects authentic comedy in their version of filming a TV commercial. A nude unsuccessfully reading for the role of ""Cinderella"" is funny, not obscene, as is an imitation of Lyndon B. Johnson.The varied views of Black Panthers, hard hats versus intellectuals on the American Flag, Women's Lib, Malcolm X and Vietnam are offered straight and/or with tongue in cheek but only with spasmodic impact. There is little doubt that a torrid, strip-teasing ""nun"" is sophomoric stuff compared with the satiric thrust of Ron Carey's swinging ""priest"" miming to the beat of Lionel Goldbart's ""God Loves Rock and Roll"" or Joan Baez's tender rendition of ""Carry It On.""In short, while no one is chicken here, ""Dynamite Chicken"" is rarely dynamite.",Review,By A.

Film: 'Winter Soldier':Vietnam Documentary Opens at Whitney,1972-01-28,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/28/archives/film-winter-soldiervietnam-documentary-opens-at-whitney.html,article,"""Winter Soldier,"" which opened at the Whitney Museum yesterday as part of its New American Filmmakers Series, is a documentary feature composed entirely of Vietnam veterans' testimony, most of which was photographed and recorded during hearings in Detroit, Jan. 31-Feb. 2, 1971, sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.It includes occasional official newsreel clips, as well as still photographs supplied by the testifying veterans (including one Brownie snapshot of a triumphant, smiling G.I. standing at the head of a newly murdered Vietnamese), but it is most agonizing in its young, barely molded words and faces—the record of men trying to make some sense of an experience that to them clearly makes no sense. Yet something very important is missing from the movie and, by extension it seems, from what might be called the American character.The movie is an oral history, told by former United States soldiers, sailors and marines who, for the most part, admit to having participated in various atrocities without question. What is obviously missing—and I suppose this is hardly news now—is some explanation as to how we could have managed to raise a couple of generations of people who could participate in the conduct described without experiencing the kind of sorrow that activates conscience. This, I assume, is the question that the film intends to raise.The other question, which is as much a moral question as a dramatic one, is what happened to change these men's minds, and when? At what point, for example, does a man, who could pose with the corpse of someone he has just shot, decide that he doesn't want to do this anymore? About halfway through ""Winter Soldier"" there is a moment that tells us about all the stories we are not hearing, when a clean-cut former G.I. recalls walking down a street in Cambridge and going out of his way to push a bearded student off the sidewalk. The student, he remembers, said simply: ""You make it very difficult for anyone to get to know you.""The former soldier then says something on the order of: ""I told my wife about this, and she helped me straighten my head out.""That is as close as ""Winter Soldier"" ever comes to providing an obligatory scene. The other conversions are unremembered. They take place silently, off-screen. All of which effectively limits the larger purposes of ""Winter Soldier,"" even for one who is sympathetic to its ends. I suspect that one of the reasons that what happened could happen is that we live in a culture whose slang, among other things, persists in referring to the mind as the head. We refuse to make distinctions that can, in the long run, recognize the difference between life and death.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

' Summer Soldiers' Studies War-Weary G.I. in Japan,1972-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/02/archives/summer-soldiers-studies-warweary-gi-in-japan.html,article,"""The summer soldier,"" wrote Tom Paine in 1776, and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.""The hero of ""Summer Soldiers,"" Hiroshi Teshigahara's new Japanese film, is an American G.I. named Jim, a dark-haired, sad-eyed, exhausted, young Vietnam veteran who, while on leave in Japan, tries to desert from the Army and winds up, weeks later, back where he started in a state of controlled despair.""Summer Soldiers"" is an intelligent, level-headed movie that refuses—bravely, I think—to deal in the sort of hysteria that denies the intention of other antiwar films. Mr. Teshigahara, the director whose ""Woman in the Dunes"" was seen here eight years ago, and John Nathan, the American who wrote the screenplay, have made an antiwar film thousands of miles from any battlefront, in terms of culture shocks, the psychology of loneliness and people working at cross-purposes with the best of intentions. Which may be why ""Summer Soldiers"" is more witty than moving, and less tragic than Jim's eventual fate would lead you to believe.The soldier is first taken in by a good-hearted, not particularly bright B-girl. ""You gonna give me a hard time?"" she says to cheer him up. He smiles, and she says it again and again and again, which are a few times too many. She, in turn, puts Jim in touch with the Deserters' Aid Committee, a group of liberal-to-radical Japanese do-gooders who ask Jim why he's deserted, then argue passionately among themselves about whether or not Jim's lack of ideology is important.""Summer Soldiers"" describes no special dramatic parabola. It moves horizontally, as Jim does, in one-night stands, from family to family, most of whom treat the soldier as an exotic object. Jim, played by Keith Sykes, remains almost as mysterious to us, essentially decent and mostly inarticulate, Mr. Teshigahara, however, has a lovely time studying the attitudes of what a Japanese radical manual (""How to Resist Arrest"") calls the ""host families.""The director has as much sympathy for these people when they are being silly or smug or insensitive as when they are being selfless and understanding. One of Jim's hosts attempts to teach him Japanese and is shocked when the American prefers to spend the night with the bar girl. The G.I. spends another night planted in front of the TV set watching a Japanese-dubbed Lucille Ball show. He can't understand a word, but the faces are as familiar as the intensity of the canned laughter.On still another night in another middle-class household, he plays a guitar and sings some songs he has written. Says the father: ""You could go on television as 'The Singing Deserter,' wearing dark glasses. You could give the money to The Movement."" ""Yes,"" says Jim, though he realizes he has no real interest in any movements.From time to time, Mr. Teshigahara cuts from the narrative to an interview with a Spanish-American deserter, Miguel (Greg Antonacci), who, unlike Jim, knows exactly what he's doing, which is preparing for revolution. Miguel jogs, he studies, he disciplines himself. ""Life is beautiful,"" he says in that glum way of someone trying to convince himself.These interludes are out of keeping with the rest of the film, which actually has less to do with specific issues than with loneliness of such desperate degree that it becomes a type of humiliation. Toward the end of the film, two Japanese school girls, members of The Movement, try to pick up the soldier in a bar in order to help him. He turns on them: ""What if I were just an ordinary guy? Would you be interested then?"" They wouldn't. It is not, perhaps, a fair question, but it makes one of the film's most sorrowful, even Buñuelian points: to recognize charity is to accept insult.""Summer Soldiers"" was shown last night at the New York Film Festival.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

The late works—“Of a Fire on the Moon” and “The Prisoner of Sex”—give “hints of exhaustion,” “evidence that Mailer's imagination of himself is becoming dangerously rigid and circumscribed, particularly when he indulges in rather simple and fashionable concerns about the future of the imagination in an age of science and technology.” And considering the work as a whole, Mr. Poirier is forced to admit. “It is … a chaotic mixture that awaits some larger redemptive effort; so that despite The Armies of the Night and Why Are We in Vietnam?

Regretfully, however, as soon as he got the Presidential nomination, McGovern began changing these positions, equivocating and hedging on previously clear positions. Finally he gave up altogether campaigning on the issues (which had admittedly grown very blurred and amorphous), and has now turned to a straight‐out personal assault on Mr. Nixon. Using the most extreme and emotional rhetoric, McGovern is concentrating all his anger on the person of the President, rather than on his record.

It also fails as a movie, but not dishonorably, and not without scoring some local successes along the way.The heroine is the young, very pregnant widow of a flier killed in Vietnam, who goes to visit her husband's mother, whom she has never seen, on a call of obligatory sympathy. She gets a lessthan-cordial reception from the mother, and discovers a miserable simple-minded teen-age sister-in-law she never knew existed. But it is only when, faced with a deepening blizzard, she is forced to spend the night and realizes with sleepy horror that someone has drugged her bedtime cocoa, that she is in present danger — and from more than just a hardhearted mother-in-law.The story that follows is full of holes and not too full of surprises, and it is all developed in a screenplay that might most charitably be described as awkward. There is a schematic simplicity to the plot that feels more like television than the movies.But there is also a visual density that is genuinely cinematic and that makes location shooting (in a real turn-of-the-century mansion in Minnesota) seem worthwhile. And the almost complete absence of false leads and tricky terror tactics suggests the kind of ground-level faith in situations and events that is the beginning of true morality in the movies.Along with its several virtues of omission, ""You'll Like My Mother"" shares in the respect for character and performance typical in Lamont Johnson's movies ""(The McKenzie Break,"" ""The Groundstar Conspiracy,"" etc.)—of which this is, in my experience, the worst. Patty Duke is expressive and surprisingly restrained as the young widow who must keep her wits about her. As her mother-in-law, Rosemary Murphy portrays a somewhat attractive villainess with an intelligent competence that is probably the best thing in the film.But I especially admired a new, rather lovely actress named—too perfectly—Sian Barbara Allen, who plays the simple-minded girl with more direct sympathy and less nonsense than you might expect in a movie the aim of which is to scare you.""You'll Like My Mother"" opened yesterday at several local theaters.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

Rostow has written some good books. This is not one of them. Rostow, who served as an adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, 1961‐69, proposes to write the his tory of the years 1957‐72, as one who has had a hand in making it. This is a perfectly legitimate under taking whose ancestry stretches from Thucydides and Julius Caesar to Churchill and Eisenhower. Others, such as Bismarck, have left us a kind of political autobiography by record ing their part in the events and re flecting upon it. Rostow has done neither but has combined the two.The hybrid form, of which this book is neither the first nor likely to be the last example, is bound to make for bad history. For the discipline of the historians' craft within which the historian must labor is vitiated by the author's concern to make sure that the reader does not miss the role he has played, and to justify it. Thus the perspective from which his tory is viewed becomes distorted. What ought to be at the periphery is moved into the center, and what is placed in the center could not pos sibly have been so central as it is made to appear. Much that deserves mention in a work of history is not mentioned at all, and some in formation is so trivial as to be out of place even in an autobiography.Thus we are told that the author was in his bath when President John son called him, and that President elect Kennedy came out of his bath when Rostow called upon him. I do not doubt that these are facts, but they certainly are not historic facts because they are of no interest to posterity. Twice Rostow quotes from remarks he made at a Pugwash Con ference, and he tells us what he said at the debriefing and that he was invited to dinner by one of the Rus sian participants. Many of us have had repeatedly similar experiences without being conscious of their his toric or even autobiographical signif icance. With Vietnam on his mind, Rostow tells us: “I left the White House just before noon on Jan. 2, 1969 with the hope that Nixon would decide to stay the course.” One al most sees darkness at noon closing in on the President's mansion.",Archives,By Hans J.

His magnificent and heartrending pictures in “Vietnam Inc.” (cloth, Macmillan, $7.95; paper, Collier Books, $3.95) testify to his horror at the corruption and the killing and his compassion for the victims. He is appalled at what he sees as the stupidity of the policies that have kept Vietnam a battleground and destroyed its people—their traditions and their countryside. Photographs like the above and on the cover of this issue are accompanied by a text and captions that further reveal his bitterness: “'Motivating’ the American soldier to fight was cause of great concern. One view was that they should be made to stay until the war was won. Considering what carnage was caused by somewhat lazy and good‐humored G.I.'s the Vietnamese people can only be thankful for their lack of ‘motivation.’ His observations and the conclusions he has reached are subjective where Miss FitzGerald's are objective, yet they are so similar to hers that “Vietnam Inc.” makes a logical companion volume to “Fire in the Lake.”",Archives,,Archives,,[]

Screen: A Rootless Life:Film About Veterans Is At Neighborhoods,1972-09-09,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/09/archives/screen-a-rootless-lifefilm-about-veterans-is-at-neighborhoods.html,article,"Richard Compton's ""Welcome Home, Soldier Boys,"" which opened very modestly at neighborhood theaters yesterday, is a largely unsuccessful, occasionally grotesque, but by no means dishonorable attempt to deal with some of the texture of rootless American life at the present time.It goes wrong—quite dreadfully wrong—in its more mechanically spectacular moments. But it seems right when it is content to roam around the towns and highways of the West and Southwest, moving all but aimlessly toward what should have been a small-scale doom.The soldier boys in question are four veterans, Green Berets, who are discharged from the Army in Arkansas, jointly buy a big black second-hand Cadillac, and set off for California to start raising cattle on land that one of them is supposed to own, but that is in fact no more than a photograph on a picture postcard. Along the way they alternately victimize and are victimized.They pick up, use, and possibly kill a tough girl hitchhiker (they never bother to see what happens when she falls out of their speeding car). They visit one boy's home, and move on, growing more desperate, and poorer. Finally, out of money and out of gas, they erupt into violence—totally destroying a tiny New Mexico town that is all too obviously a surrogate Vietnamese village—and absurdly simplifying a movie that could have taken something better.Each of the boys has a certain edgy individuality, and their leader, Danny (Joe Don Baker) seems genuinely complex with his imposing slouch, his defiant eyes and mumbled speech. Indeed, I am not sure but that what impressed me most about him was my being unable to make out more than a third of his dialogue—and feeling that all that inarticulate talk was an expressive part of a characterization.But it is as a road movie that ""Welcome Home, Soldier Boys"" really comes into its own. Five minutes here, 10 minutes there, motel scenes at night, or driving through the early morning—scenes that don't finally co-here but that do stand out for a kind of lyricism and reticence and subtlety of observation. There is a quality of emptiness and random pathos to the film that is ultimately rather lovely, and that belongs as much to the spirit of American movie making as it does to the spirit of American life.This doesn't add up to a good movie, but it adds up to a sporadically interesting one—in which the failure of the whole is no measure of some of the parts.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
