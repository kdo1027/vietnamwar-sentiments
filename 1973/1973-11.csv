Screen: By Danny Lyon:The Program,1973-11-03,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/03/archives/screen-by-danny-lyonthe-program.html,article,"""The Films of Danny Lyon,"" the new program at the Film Forum, is a collection of three documentary films by the 31-year-old Brooklyn-born still photographer turned film-maker. The two best films in the collection, ""Llanito"" (61 minutes) and ""Soc. Sci. 127"" (21 minutes) are defined less by a developed cinematic style than by compassion for the subjects.""Llanito"" is a sorrowful montage of scenes of Indian life in the tiny New Mexico town of that name. It is not an especially finished film, but perhaps Mr. Lyon does not mean it to be.A couple of Indian men, half-kidding, dance around a beer can in a back alley. We listen to another man boast to the camera about his prowess as a hunter, while his mother mutters that the only thing he is good at is drinking.Juxtaposed against these scenes are others set in a home for the retarded, where, among other things, we listen to a white teen-age boy, who speaks in a high falsetto voice, telling us about freedom, sin, the crucifixion of Christ and the creation of the world (""God made everything out of nothing"").Mr. Lyon's fondness for bizarre images is balanced by a kind of solemn respect for his subjects. This is particularly true in ""Soc. Sci. 127,"" about an eccentric, hard-drinking tattoo artist named Bill Sanders, who, while he works, rambles on about Vietnam, lesbians and the art of what he advertises as ""velvety tattoos.""The third film on the program, ""El Chivot"" (The Goat) is a series of free associations on the life of goat and Indian. It runs six long, pretentious minutes.Mr. Lyon's skills as a photographer are evident throughout but I had the feeling in each of the films that he was still searching his images to find out what they might mean. This is not quite good enough.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

Suspense Film Dramatizes Kennedy Assassination:The Cast,1973-11-08,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/08/archives/suspense-film-dramatizes-kennedy-assassinationthe-cast.html,article,"If disbelief is one of our healthiest national reflexes, at least it has been well exercised in the years between the Warren Report and the latest protestations about the nonbeing of those Presidential tapes. The only danger is that fact itself can be a victim of disbelief: Ugly news that happens to be true becomes easier to ignore, and good news gets rejected with a cackle.""Executive Action,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet, offers a tactful, low-key blend of fact and invention. The film makers do not insist that they have solved John Kennedy's murder; instead, they simply evoke what might have happened, according to various researchers, including Mark Lane.The result is a cool, skillful, occasionally confusing argument for conspiracy. Wealthy rightwingers (Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan) wanted Kennedy removed because he was going to sign the test-ban treaty, ""lead the black revolution"" and probably pull out of Vietnam. The last two points may give you the hiccups, but that is what these characters say.Like calm businessmen, they organize the event. While three talented marksmen rehearse by shooting at dummies in a car driven through the desert, the conspirators search for a nut to use as a patsy.Throughout the stress is on technology — even Oswald's name comes out of a computer. The movie follows the ""second Oswald"" theory, and this part of the plot is deftly constructed, as is the disappearance of the three marksmen, also the calculations to ""have the F.B.I. watching the C.I.A."" and vice versa, while relying on the inefficiency of the Secret Service.The conspirators are cleverly cloaked in the style of Camelot itself. Lancaster and Ryan appear as pensive, practical semi-academics, rationally planning an act as bloody as a small foreign invasion. (They admit that they sometimes ""sound like gods,"" since they are also planning the world's future — ""Well, somebody's got to do it."") Both have the confidence and the casual class that we recall in many Kennedy appointees. Lancaster, looking miraculously young, overdoes the ""sincerity"" at moments—an old habit of his. And there are too many shots of the conspirators smiling ironically at once another. But Ryan is wonderfully benign and wry, wisely underplaying where others might have gone all out for evil.However, it is far more painful to think of Ryan's death — a few weeks after this movie was finished — than Kennedy's. And that is the problem lurking in this movie. Television footage is used to paw at the public's sentiments; we see Kennedy smiling and golfing and kissing his children, as well as making speeches. But ""Executive Action"" is emotionally disconnected from history to the degree that those with an affection for suspense can enjoy the build-up of the plotting — even though we know how the assassination turned out.Despite the flags crawling down flagpoles and the drumbeats, a national trauma has become a competent thriller. And it is just as well. Reliving the shock of that killing would hardly benefit any kind of audience now.So whether you chime with this interpretation, or, like a few I know, decide to embrace all the conspiracy theories of the assassination, the movie is useful in rousing the questions once again. The film's sternest and strongest point is that only a crazed person acting on his own would have been acceptable to the American public — which, at that time, certainly did not want to believe in a conspiracy.",Review,By Nora Sayre,Archives,,[]

His record was so good that the judge allowed him one week after sentencing to make arrangements for Eric (our son) and me before reporting to prison. It is obvions that John is not a dangerous person. It is inconceivable that any man who refuses to join the Army for moral reasons, knowing that a refusal means a prison sentence, could be considered dangerous. John refused to join the Army because he believes it is morally wrong to kill and wrong to be any part of an organization designed for the destruction of human lives.",Archives,By Kathleen A.

Clive Barnes: “The New York Shakespeare Festival's first play at the Vivian Beaumont Theater is the fourth play by David Rabe that Joseph Papp has produced, and it is also the first play by David Rabe that does not deal with Vietnam. The problem is to decide what it does deal with. It is possibly intended as a portrait of a young tramp as a neurotic. Its heroine is Chrissie, a gogo girl in Philadelphia, who dreams of—well, she seems to dream of very little really. The trouble with the play is that we are asked to spend three hours with Chrissie, and we really know no more about her at the end than we did at the beginning. It would have been quicker to send a telegram. Mr. Rabe was not helped at all by the production, which seemed to fasten on the weakest aspects of the play. The play is said to be directed by Mr. Papp, but, of course, as has been announced, Julie Bovasso was in charge until a few days ago. Still, as it is, Mr. Papp must take the rap. Let us hope that the Shakespeare Festival will have better luck next time.” For Walter Kerr, see Page 3.",Archives,,Archives,,[]
