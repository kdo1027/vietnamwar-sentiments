Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie',1969-07-22,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/07/22/archives/screen-andy-warhols-blue-movie.html,article,"ANDY WARHOL'S ""Blue Movie"" is heterosexual pornography, somewhat more cheerful than the sort of thing shown at smokers, much longer (105 minutes) than the usual stag films, and fitted out with lots of random talk about such subjects as athlete's foot, Vietnam, cops, Nixon, Lindsay, termites and praying mantises.In its crucial moments, it's just as cold and mechanical as any conventional blue movie, principally because it's impossible to be a third party in such circumstances and not feel slightly absurd, aware of physical details that—once seen—really aron't very interesting in themselves. I don't think that ""Blue Movie"" will have an adverse effect on any normal, coping, neurotic adult, but then I don't think it will enrich one's consciousness, except at the chaotic speed with which our public morality is changing, and of the Warhol continuum, a life style and a body of work that are as indigenously American as commercial television.""Blue Movie"" pretends to dramatize sex as the ultimate act of political protest, which, I suppose, it does, as would any movie—even one about water skiing—in which the characters are so preoccupied with one specific activity that they have no time for anything else. According to a program note, ""Blue Movie"" is ""a film about the Vietnam war and what we can do about it."" By this same reasoning, it's a film about air pollution, vivisection, campus reform, the cause of the Count of Paris and stamp collecting, and what can we do about them, which is, as I understand it, nothing.Warhol, who is a master in the art of reversals, structures his blue movie more or less backwards. It opens with a medium close-up of Viva, looking rather more fit than usual (and sometimes even beautiful), and Louis Waldon, a pleasant, stocky, 30-ish man, fully clothed, wrestling on a bed. Without too much hesitation they make love, then talk a great deal, have some hamburgers, talk, take a shower—all of which, of course, dramatizes what we can do about Vietnam.Having experimented—not very effectively—with cuts between close-ups, long-shots and even panoramic vistas in ""Lonesome Cowboys,"" filmed in chilly Arizona exteriors, Warhol in ""Blue Movie"" returns to the confined interior landscapes (bedroom, bath and kitchen) that he knows best, most of the time alternating between tight and medium close-ups.Some of the images—not the clinical ones—are quite good, pure nudes caught in the time and space available only to the movie camera. For the most part, it all looks quite impersonally improvised, except for a startling moment near the end that may be a sort of minimal hommage to Truffaut and ""Stolen Kisses."" Waldon, in profile close to camera, repeats ""I love you, I love you, I love you,"" while, in the background Viva goes about the ritual of getting dressed, fixing her hair and, in general, behaving like a real woman. Stag films aren't supposed to be sweet.""Blue Movie,"" which is literally a cool, greenish-blue in color, opened yesterday at the Andy Warhol Garrick Theater.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

The Gay Deceivers',1969-07-31,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/07/31/archives/the-gay-deceivers.html,article,"""THE GAY DECEIVERS,"" which struggles with the comparatively new movie twist of feigned homosexuality as a draft dodging gimmick, is, unfortunately, neither gay nor deceptive. Although it is pleasingly multicolored, this decidedly juvenile caper evolves as a colorless case of a couple of young swingers, whose involved efforts to avoid Uncle Sam's tour of Vietnam, is neither funny nor serious.Amid what can be assumed to be plush California country-club surroundings, our heroes—a designing pre-law student and his handsome, bronzed, muscled lifeguard pal — con their draft board colonel into thinking they are delicate bosom buddies. In order to make this temporary deferment permanent they even rent a cozy, plush cottage done up in hot pinks and torrid reds by its owner, an authentic lacy type.Why this colonel would single them out for personal investigation is difficult to comprehend but he's an indomitable sleuth who gives our boys all kinds of headaches.The hectic business of eluding him, the student's suspicious fiancée and his parents—as well as some panting girls who turn up at this unlikely pad—becomes a witless charade with practically everyone a loser.Kevin Coughlin, a former child actor, grapples unsuccessfully with the role of the harried student who is hardly a grownup no matter what the script says. Larry Casey, a newcomer, is more photogenic than convincing as the masquerading lifeguard who, like his buddy, ends up a woebegone reject.There is a parade of young girls frequently in bikinis and sexily hip enough to titillate the red-blooded boys. And, the producers rate a credit for including a gay party thrown by Michael Greer, an amusing performer, as the owner of the cottage that should please that division of our voters. Mr. Greer sashays about the premises in a frilly, mod get-up as he introduces a pair of lisping guests as ""Myra Broken-bridge"" and ""Judy Streisand.""But the gaiety is rare. ""Living with you,"" Mr. Coughlin angrily berates his roommate, ""is just a series of bad jokes."" Call it a precise summation by a pre-law student for the case of ""The Gay Deceivers.""",Review,A. H. WEILER,Archives,,[]
