'First to Fight' Waves the Flag,1967-03-30,https://www.nytimes.com/1967/03/30/archives/first-to-fight-waves-the-flag.html,article,"SAY this for ""First to Fight,"" an old-style, flag-waving tribute to marine valor in World War II, which Warners unveiled yesterday. It has every war cliché except the soldier comic from Brooklyn and possibly the Crossing of the Delaware. Maybe the smoke hid that one.There is every good reason why Warners, at a time when World War II seems remote and Vietnam so very real, should have packaged a patriotic reminder of the past. As a matter of fact, the picture is exactly the kind the studio rolled out after Pearl Harbor.There's this clean-cut, stalwart winner of the Distinguished Service Cross, Chad Everett, who is pulled back to the States for a war-bond tour, when he marries a pretty girl. Feeling guilt as a boot-camp instructor, he manages to rejoin the guys back in the Pacific, freezes in fear in a major battle (the thought of his wife, to the strains of ""As Time Goes By""), then straightens up and saves the day.The picture has two big, noisy, churning battle scenes that are pips, as directed by Christian Nyby. But all the rest, for all its sincerity, is strictly standard. Mr. Everett, Marilyn Devin, Dean Jagger and Gene Hackman do what they can. But, in an oddly affecting scene with Mr. Everett and Miss Devin watching the old ""Casablanca."" Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart and Dooley Wilson do better and did better.",Review,,Archives,,[]
