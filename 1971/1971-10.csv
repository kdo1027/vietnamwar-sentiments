Screen: Stember's '7254':Forum Offers Diffuse Saga of Young Man,1971-10-15,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/15/archives/screen-stembers-7254forum-offers-diffuse-saga-of-young-man.html,article,"The Film Forum rates credit for lending a helping hand to another aspiring, if unsung, moviemaker, by giving theatrical exposure to John Stember's first film, ""7254,"" which will run at that intimate showcase for generally noncommercial fare today through Sunday. But good deeds and intentions aside, Mr. Stember, who is a fashion photographer, gives us a good deal less than meets the eye or the ear in this ill-defined and disconnected saga of a modern young man's angst in a world rent by wars and other dissensions.Mr. Stember, who produced and directed from his story and for his own company, SHA Productions, apparently was uncertain about just how he would project the problems endured by his vaguely limned but highly distraught hero.What we're exposed to is a series of vignettes photographed in color against mostly local backgrounds that give the impression of having been tossed in merely to indicate progressive anxieties.The anxieties appear to have basis in awesome facts. We see televised scenes indicating Hitler's holocausts, and others, up to and including Vietnam. Vietnam is what appears to have set off our troubled pettish hero, Alan Midgette. In disjointed scenes, he is oddly unresponsive to the pleas of his nude, beautiful but callow wife (Phoebe McAdams) to come to bed; to his loquacious, divorced mother (Ruth Ford) and her saccharine adoration, and to a vague, older friend (Paul Gallan), who, at one point, chases him desperately as he rows down a sylvan stream.Unfortunately, Mr. Midgette, a lank-haired, slightly delicate blond type sporting a flowing white scarf, is given to long, moody silences and few words that convey coherency or depth. In a reflective sequence shot for no real reason on a windswept beach through waving weeds, his Vietnam observations include, ""Those are real babies crying, this war is a crime against nature.""The dialogue, done in an ad lib, Andy Warhol technique, is not a crime against nature but it does little to put the principals in sharp focus. Nor does it do much for the meaning of the climax, which has our tortured Alan fleeing inexplicably from everyone at an airport.The title, ""7254,"" a program note says, is the ""Kodak designation for color negative film."" Well, it wasn't used especially positively this time.",Review,By A. H. Weiler,Archives,,[]
