His reference to the Saigon airport as “Cain Hut Thuoc” was surprising, since news dispatches when the airport has been under Vietcong fire have referred to it as Tansonnhut. Remembering a few words of Vietnamese, however, I realized that Mr. Kahn had miscopied the words from a sign which said “Cam Hut Thuoc,” which means No Smoking! In this respect he has joined another unwitting punster, Robert S. McNamara; the former Secretary of Defense originally pronounced the name of that sad country “Veet Nam,” to rhyme with “fleet Sam,” apparently thereby designating it in Vietnamese as “sick duck!”",Archives,"Mark J.

Screen: 'The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus',1971-05-31,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/31/archives/screen-the-great-chicago-conspiracy-circus.html,article,"If you recall last year's Off Broadway ""Chicago 70,"" which was put on by the Toronto Workshop Company at the Martinique Theater here, you're hereby apprised that the 16mm. color film version on view at the Film Forum through next weekend is essentially the same improvisational dramatization. It includes excerpts of the 1969-70 trial of the ""Chicago 8"" with infusions of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" juvenile classroom recitations and pseudo-radio broadcasts. The film version, labeled ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus,"" is decidedly true to its title as ""circus,"" ""conspiracy"" and justifiable polemics, but it is rarely moving as movie drama.Basically, a moviegoer is affected by what he sees and even if the truth, like the politics of our time, is both tragic and comic, it has to be strongly visualized as well as declared on screen. There is a great speaking of minds from the actual record in ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus"" but, unfortunately, there is not a great deal to stir the hearts or the eyes of the uninitiate.As noted, the polemics as well as the confusion of a baffled Judge Julius J. Hoffman facing the taunts and life-style (and the psychedelic dress) of the disparate likes of Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, Allen Ginsberg (reciting some of his explicitly sexual poems) and Country Joe McDonald singing his anti-Vietnam rock, are forceful and to the point.One is also Impressed that maintaining law and order before defendants and attorneys who are trying to stress that the court is not their idea of law and order any more than is Mayor Richard J. Daly's rule of Chicago strikes effective notes for both the Establishment and a younger generation divorced from it.Kerry Feltham, the director, who has employed practically the same cast that George Luscombe used in the play, has drawn forthright declamations from all of them, both black and white. And, it must be noted that, while it is sometimes confusing, different actors are sometimes switched to play the same role, such as Judge Hoffman's, and do prove their versatility.The cast, to name a few such as Mel Dixon, Jim Lawrence, Peter Faulkner, Neil Walsh and Diane Grant and not to slight the others, are Yippie, hippie and serious enough to project authentic dedication to their art and dialogue. But like the documentary ""Breathing Together: Revolution of the Electric Family,"" seen here last month and also dealing with the trial, ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus,"" which was photographed on sets with a mirror background, is generally as static as a photographed play.What the Toronto Workshop Company has to say is obviously ingenious theater even if it is political and perhaps partisan. But it is, sadly enough, good rhetoric that does not add up to an exciting or innovative film.",Review,By A. H. Weiler,Archives,,[]
