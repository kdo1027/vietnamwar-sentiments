The cause was a crisis of confidence over the Dominican Republic intervention and, of course, because of doubts over Vietnam. He thinks there should be more consultation and interchange of information, but points out that situations differ: that in the Cubancrisis Congressional debate might have led to war, while in the Dominican intervention it might have led to a less precipitous policy.

The Screen:Documentary on Cuba Is at New Yorker,1971-11-19,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/19/archives/the-screendocumentary-on-cuba-is-at-new-yorker.html,article,"Felix Greene, the British cameraman-journalist-author, who gave us feature-length color close-ups of ""China!"" in 1965 and ""North Vietnam"" two years later, continues his role as a movie Marco Polo for the embattled Left in ""Cuba Va!"", his latest color documentary on a nation largely concealed by a ""curtain."" As in the previous cases, he illustrates a contented people, who admittedly haven't yet achieved their revolutionary goals but are, as the title translates, moving forward.Using some old black-and-white footage to stress the enrichment of the few wealthy, both local and foreign, and the deprivation of the masses of the poor and ignorant Latin Americans, Greene, who shot his color film over the last year or so, makes visual comparisons in generally calm and effective style.With Premier Fidel Castro appearing on a few occasions to explain that Cuban freedom could be achieved only by revolution after 400 years of foreign domination, the film's natural bias is apparent but not overpowering. It opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema.The ""85 per cent"" illiteracy that existed 12 years ago when Castro ousted the former dictator, Fulgencio Batista, is given cheerful counterpoint by happy youngsters and adults receiving free education and instruction in trades in various immaculate up-to-date urban and rural schools. The admitted fact that did not meet its 10-million-ton sugar cane goal last year is offset by various scenes showing the harvesting of eight and a half million tons, a record crop.A viewer is fascinated by workers from other areas chipping to voluntarily to help with the cane, tobacco and other harvests; by a fine teachers college, medical school with many distaff students, and an especially modern psychiatric hospital near Havana; by an orchestra devoted to Western classics that is viewed, somewhat less favorably, than an excellent modern dance team working with native rhythms as another sign of Cuba's socialistic approach to the arts.One is impressed by younger composer-guitarists such as Silvio Rodriguez, Noel Nicola and Pablo Milanes, whose fine voices extol their brave new world. And one assumes that Mr. Greene knows what he is talking about in noting that ""the cinemas are filled and a nightclub has to be booked weeks in advance.""One also get glimpses of modern highways being built and slums being razed and a climactic scene showing Cubans reacting forcefully in Havana demonstrations when their captive fishermen were freed by Americans last year. The over-all impression sought by Mr. Greene is a bright present and a brighter future. But despite his largely happy vistas, his ""Cuba Va!"" leaves a nagging feeling that it is only a partial view of current history that still desperately needs fuller explanations.Also on the bill is ""Reggae,"" a 60-minute documentary on Jamaican music filmed at a concert in London last year and intercut with observations on its origins and purposes. As an outgrowth of traditional African, calypso, rock, soul and blues, its beat is infectious.And, even though Mike Raven, a British disk jockey, explains that ""Reggae"" was the name of the first record label to feature that genre and that it is also a form of protest, it is basically an item for the buffs, who should appreciate it most.",Review,By Howard Thompson,Archives,,[]

See this engrossing film, which has a cast headed by Mike Simms and Burl Bullock, excellent color photography by Mike Rhodes and keen direction by Wendell James Franklin. The catch is one puzzling bit of action at the finale.As for Horace Jackson, the scenarist-producer, he is an important man. K-Calb is off to a beautiful start.",Review,HOWARD THOMPSON,Archives,,[]
