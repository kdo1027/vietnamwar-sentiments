'Gordon's War' Views Drug Scene,1973-08-10,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/10/archives/gordons-war-views-drug-scene.html,article,"In ""Gordon's War,"" four black veterans of Vietnam wage fierce personal battle, using Army tactics, against drug channelers in Harlem. What, indeed, could be more admirable? This is a worthy film, whose format and substance—a black theme dramatized, for practical, constructive purposes—remain exceeded by its goal.The picture is tough, fast, moves in a straight line with no sideline fiddling but with pungent humor and vividly jabs the crime-ridden underbelly of Harlem. The sharp direction of Ossie Davis catches the argot, the flavor and the sinister ambiance of the area. And Mr. Davis stages a wingding of a car-motorcycle chase near the end.But the picture is inconclusive, far from profound, and the urgency of the theme has been overly simplified to fit the action. Only in the first part of the script is there character probing, as Paul Winfield (of ""Sounder"") broods over the addiction of his dead wife and recruits his three pals for personal and moral vengeance. A real uptown dope purge, says somebody, ""would take an army.""These four—Carl Lee, David Dowling and Tony King are the others—do very well on their own. Fiercely, methodically, the good guys nail the bad guys, with comparative ease. No policeman or detective, black or white, ever appears. At the fade-out, which simply hangs in midair like a warning, four white business executives are lined up as the culprits. ""Gordon's War"" is well-fought but definitely not the drug war to end them all.",Review,,Archives,,[]
