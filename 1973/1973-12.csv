Screen:' David Holzman Diary' Spoofs Cinema Verite,1973-12-07,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/07/archives/screen-david-holzman-diary-spoofs-cinema-verite.html,article,"""Life as a work of art""—at least once a decade that ancient concept seduces some members of yet another generation, and inspires them to hash up their lives in the name of truth or beauty. Jim McBride's ""David Holzman's Diary,"" a totally delightful satire on ""the blubber about cinéma vérité,"" mocks those ghastly reels from the nineteen-sixties, when various film makers immortalized themselves or their friends by trying and failing to be spontaneous. ""Diary,"" which derides directors who scorned imagination or invention while worshiping the camera, opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art.Holzman, an earnest young Godard-hound, decides to film his life in order to understand it—and only succeeds in ruining it. As a voyeur, a gentle intruder into other people's lives, he can't understand that the filming makes his subjects feel self-conscious, or that ""reality"" is altered by the presence of his camera and his tape recorder and his lavalier mike, which he calls his ""friends.""His girlfriend, who detests his movie-making, finally leaves him because of it. He's already told us in a dry, flat voice that he really loves her, though he can't resist pointing out that she's ""dirty, sloppy."" Forlornly, he adds, ""I don't quite get her sense of privacy."" After she's gone, he argues that masturbation is an improvement on the real thing because You can think of anything . . . pigs. Think of trains going in tunnels. Think of bagels. I mean, you're not limited to women.""However, his obsession with freezing everything on celluloid rarely allows him any other fantasies. He gives manic attention to every detail of his New York neighborhood, from derelict sofas on the street to the installation of matchstick bamboo blinds in a nearby apartment, and finally gets slugged by a cop for filming people through their windows.Soon, we realize that the camera is his analyst. He tells it everything, and then grows furious because it doesn't answer him with ""the right things,"" and also makes him ""do things"" that he wouldn't ordinarily do. Accusingly, he asks it, ""What do you want?"" Then he shouts at the lens that it hasn't helped him—just as a frustrated patient may denounce an all too silent psychiatrist.""Diary"" was made in 1967, and time has served it very well. We get a pungent flash on the past when a radio announces the numbers killed in the Newark riots, or refers to ""the new Israel-Egyptian cease-fire,"" or quotes the Pentagon on the probable increase of American forces in Vietnam next year. But aside from politics, that period now seems a rather innocent one in retrospect, and the character of David Holzman (admirably played by L. M. Kit Carson) distills the eager naiveté that accompanied the zest for technology, deliberate inarticulation and the mistrust of words, the vibes and the hoaxes and all the lighter put-ons of 1967.At the end, Holzman is bitterly disappointed that his movie and his camera have taught him nothing — least of all how to control his life. The picture reminds me of the late A. J. Liebling's recollection of being 23 in Paris, when he felt that his life hinged on an impossible decision. Meanwhile, he was writing a novel about a 23-year-old in Paris whose future hung upon an insoluble choice. When the character caught up with the day of his own life that he was describing, he couldn't finish the book. Jim McBride's movie evokes the spirit of Liebling's enormous laughter when he remarked that few diaries yield conclusions or solutions.",Review,By Nora Sayre,Archives,,[]
