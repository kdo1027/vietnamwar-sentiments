McCarthy, Emile de Antonio has now assembled ""In the Year of the Pig,"" a documentary on American involvement in Vietnam. It will nail many people to their seats.There are no frills and few ifs, ands or buts about the stinging, graphic and often frighteningly penetrating movie that arrived yesterday at the New Yorker Theater. Adhering strictly to a dove viewpoint, Mr. de Antonio's picture suggests that we should get out of Vietnam fast. To make his points he uses footage culled from international sources, interspersing, with enormous effectiveness, statements on both sides by political and military leaders, as well as teachers, officials and on-the-spot journalists.Even with its frank slant, the picture is invaluable on two counts. First, it provides a succinct, backward refresher course on our initial Vietnamese involvement, a needed primer for spectators confusingly numbed by the appalling facts of the present. Second, although some of the footage speaks volumes, it is the statements by the men who led us there and those who went there that cut through to the quick.With some of the unseen speakers, a good bit of the footage is random and sketchy, such as a portion on the French-Indochinese war, which is repeatedly likened to our involvement. Some of the vignettes are memorable, such as one little drama involving white-suited colonials and rickshaw coolies. In another clip, some husky American soldiers cavorting on a Vietnamese beach scornfully profess disinterest in native girls, described as a ""bunch of slant-eyed gooks."" Commenting on a memorial service for American troops, Col. George S. Patton 3d smilingly recalls them as ""looking determined and reverent,"" adding: ""But they're still a bloody good bunch of killers.""One detailed sequence with a clutter of expressionless natives being firmly shepherded by American soldiers is a microcosm of the Vietnam war. But it is the almost unbroken flow of personal testimonies, for and against our military involvement, that will jolt the viewer, ranging from that given by combat soldiers to those by former President Lyndon B. Johnson and President Nixon.The film ends with the strains of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" while an American unit agonizingly hobbles into a clearing in the forest bearing its maimed and wounded.",Review,By Howard Thompson,Archives,,[]

Except for a large bottle of Coca-Cola (handy symbolic refreshment) the setting, a room in Sweden, is neutral. And except for some moderately objectionable intercutting among strands in his narration, the filmmaker, Bill Brodie, has kept himself out of the picture.Mr. Whitmore seems to have been allowed to talk about what he wanted, and in his own time. Unfortunately, although he talks a great deal, he has very little to say.Terry Whitmore is a 21-year-old Negro (his word) from Memphis, who enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating from high school. He was sent to Vietnam and wounded in action. In Japan, where he recuperated from his wounds, he decided to desert rather than return to Vietnam. With the help of a Japanese antiwar group, he was transported across Russia to his present asylum in Sweden.It is a life story more interesting than most, but interesting life stories do not necessarily reveal interesting lives. Mr. Whitmore knows when he is well off, and he seems to have turned his suffering more to profit than to pathos, but he demonstrates a mind without depth or originality, and a personality in which it is difficult to place much confidence.He seems to have hated boot camp and his drill instructors (though anybody who enlists in the Marines presumably asks for what he gets) but not really to resent Vietnam or actual combat. Obviously, he preferred shooting people to having people shoot at him, and when he does indulge in moral scruples about the war it sounds a little too much like a recital of Americal Imperialist Atrocities Against the People of South Vietnam to be believed.His historical analyses are inventive (the United States entered World War II solely to ""get a piece of Europe""), but his battle stories are traditional. I don't mean that they are untrue; only that they are utterly uninstructive.I assume that Terry Whitmore deserted because he had been seriously wounded once and didn't feel like taking more dumb chances. This seems reason enough for deserting, but not reason enough for making a movie. ""Terry Whitmore, for Example"" does not figure effectively as a protest against American involvement in Vietnam. It doesn't even figure effectively as a protest against war, since, from his own description of his previous life, Mr. Whitmore apparently lived most sensitively and vigorously in Vietnam.Cinéma vérité is supposed to reveal character. In this the film succeeds—and succeeds within the first 10 of its 98 minutes. But it is a success without passion, or pleasure, or evident purpose.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

The Screen:' Deserter U.S.A.' Tells of Soldiers in Sweden,1969-11-25,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/11/25/archives/the-screen-deserter-usa-tells-of-soldiers-in-sweden.html,article,"SOONER or later, a provocative movie about American soldier-deserters from Vietnam is bound to emerge from their Swedish sanctuary.""Terry Whitmore, for Example,"" which arrived several weeks ago, seemed pallid stuff. Even more surprising is the hollow, unforceful ring of ""Deserter U.S.A.,"" in which three more young ex-soldiers, named Bill Jones, John Ashley and Mark Shapiro, aim testimonials at the camera, directly and indirectly, while re-enacting their early years of foreign sanctuary.Assembled by two young Swedes, Lars Lambert and Olle Sjogren, the Kanawha Films import opened yesterday at the Garrick Theater.What kills the effect of the picture is the format, which cries out for compression as a candid, documentary-interview television special. Instead, what we see—and hear is a melodrama about three rootless young fugitives roughing it in a new land.The unyielding tone, bordering on paranoia, encompasses some hard-breathing little vignettes depicting cloak-and-dagger menace of the deserters by the Swedish ""secret police,"" the United States Army, the Central Intelligence Agency and some unidentified snoops. With perhaps two exceptions, the nonprofessional status of the entire cast is painfully obvious.What pierces the strangely synthetic flavor of the film, and the sing-song flow of anti-American redundancies, is the fiery-eyed adamancy of its chief spokesman, young Jones, who is never at a loss for words, at least against his native land and its ""great war machine.""Nor is Sweden spared, initially, after the outspoken three leave a luxurious lakeside villa. Granted a welfare pittance by the watchful and irritated Swedish Government, they form a committee with other American deserters.The typical American deserter's hand-to-mouth existence, underscored by Jones's narration, includes some comfortably appointed rooms, apartments, discothèques and a bustling little printing plant for committee writings. But the majority of complaints by the group of deserters, seconded by their young Sdedish friends, pinpoints the ""economic reasons of American imperialism,"" from Vietnam back to World War II.In the most telling utterance of the moive, a Negro deserter abruptly recalls the arrest of Rap Brown and LeRoi Jones for illegal possession of weapons, adding: ""Then when Lester Maddox had weapons down in that restaurant of his, they made him Governor.""But at the other extreme it's impossible to swallow the committee's claim of continual harassment by the homeland, from near and afar. In a phone conversation with his mother, one ex-soldier shouts: ""Who called you? Who made you call me over here!"" Other young men are shown being trailed by ""the secret police."" Still another one is glimpsed in a street scuffle—""attacked by American tourists.""In contrast, a climactic sequence — performed with ceremonial triumph, when the committee ""traps"" a Central Intelligence Agency man, posing as a journalist—is so absurdly staged and played as to be laughable.""Deserter U.S.A."" is no laughing matter. But as pertinent, personalized drama, it outweighs principle with prejudice.",Review,By Howard Thompson,Archives,,[]
