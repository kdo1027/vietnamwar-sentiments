Screen: 'Changes' Opens:Novices in Cast Make Story More Touching,1969-02-12,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/02/12/archives/screen-changes-opensnovices-in-cast-make-story-more-touching.html,article,"IF ""Changes"" had a culminating dramatic effect equal to its perception and visual beauty, the picture, which arrived yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, would be a masterpiece. Even so, it is one of the most imaginative, haunting and artistic movies yet made of contemporary youth at bay. It is a remarkable film and—more than that—a remarkable experience.Written by Bill E. Kelly and Hall Bartlett, with the latter producing and directing, the picture trails a young Candide—a college drop-out from a good family—in a quest for self-fulfillment in today's unsettled society.The film has been photographed against a magnificent sweep of natural background, in superlatively trenchant color, directed with uncommon skill and sensitivity and played by a cast predominantly of unknowns.This Cinerama Corporation release is one of those infrequent pictures that draw you inside from the start, as the open-faced protagonist, Kent Lane, moodily scans a coastline and then speeds over a highway, pinpointed by the camera. Much of the freshness and persuasion of what follows are attributable to young Lane, a manly towhead, in his screen debut.Furthermore, the characterization is neither that of a yowling, bearded hippie nor a professional whiner, but of a disturbed rebel who really matters. In clipped vignettes that often dip into flashback, we see his troubled home in a moving scene with his baffled parents (only Jack Albertson is credited), and his restless college enrolment, before he takes up with a pretty artist, Manuela Thiess. Later, he drifts into a casual involvement with a freelance reporter, Marcia Strassman, and, finally, an extended interlude with a sleazy, understanding girl, exquisitely played by Michele Carey.The movie is entirely credible as the camera scans faces and meaningful details, with much of the footage set to Lane's introspective musings. Time and again, the camera searches beyond the hero, as when he mingles with a hippie assembly and watches Peace-in-Vietnam marchers scuffling with the police. There also is a memorable scene when the hitchhiking hero and his driver hear a radio news summary that ends with details about a black-power riot. Then the driver, a fine-looking Negro, calmly dials off to some music, and the two men smile at each other. They're bored with it all.But a picture that conveys so much, with such skill and beauty, requires a heartrending wallop, not the rather comfortable fadeout. Even so, ""Changes,"" while flawed, is still real and wonderful.",Review,By Howard Thompson,Archives,,[]

Screen: 'Model Shop' Looks Out on Los Angeles,1969-02-12,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/02/12/archives/screen-model-shop-looks-out-on-los-angeles.html,article,"""THE MODEL SHOP,"" Jacques Demy's first American movie, looks and sounds like a film made by a sensitive tourist. The French director (""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"") brings back Lola, the beautiful, emotionally dented leading character of his first movie, and transplants her from Nantes to Los Angeles.Abandoned by her husband, Lola works in a garish little photographic studio—a kind of house of prostitution for the inhibited—where a customer can rent a camera and a girl and take his own pictures.Although Gary Lockwood and Anouk Aimée (the original Lola) are the stars of ""The Model Shop,"" they obviously aren't as important to Demy as Los Angeles. Lockwood, a young, disoriented architect about to go to Vietnam, calls the city ""pure poetry,"" and Demy pictorially defines this in a series of loving, nightmarish explorations of that solid-state grid of boulevards, parking lots, two-story loft buildings, drugstores, supermarkets and beach houses.Demy is almost right. In ""The Model Shop"" you don't experience Los Angeles as often as you read it, on billboards and neon signs, in a freeze-dried vocabulary of words like Sale, Eat, Wash and Service. Even the dialogue has a linear quality. Speeches sound as if they had originally been long subtitles translating the original French.This is only one of the reasons that nothing in ""The Model Shop"" quite connects with anything else. The screenplay by Demy (""English dialogue by Adrien Joyce"") is as aimless and well-meaning as its characters, who are always getting in and out of automobiles in search of something better, constantly accompanied by music (Bach, rock, Schumann and Rimsky-Korsakov), sometimes heard on the car radios, sometimes—quite arbitrarily—on the soundtrack.Specifically, the movie covers 24 hours in the life of a disenchanted young man (Lockwood), whose affair with a staggeringly dense, would-be actress (Alexandra Hay) is breaking up. He meets Miss Aimée, falls in love with her, and after much coffee house philosophy about war, marriage, love and politics, they part.None of this, however, is as pure or poetic as the city that surrounds them. They talk in big, heavy swatches of exposition, punctuated from time to time by selfconscious messages from the author. ""Do I bore you?"" Miss Aimée asks during one very long speech, which is the tip-off that Demy knows that we know that the movie has gotten away from him.Miss Aimée is a fine, striking-looking woman, but her natural elegance makes her appearance in the rent-a-girl studio something of a sight gag. (Her leg tendons are rather pronounced for cheesecake work.) Lockwood is good as the young man, but he's always an American actor in what is basically, spiritually, a foreign film. Miss Hay's work can't be precisely evaluated. It's impossible to tell how much of her edgy clumsiness is good acting or inexperience.""The Model Shop,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous and Loew's Orpheum, is really quite a bad movie, but also a sometimes interesting one. You aren't likely to forget—immediately anyway—a movie in which someone speaks of the ""Baroque geometry"" of Los Angeles. I know that I won't.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
