More than 50 companies are drilling, doing geological studies or hold ing concessions. This activity has drawn the attention of some antiwar groups that have charged that the United States is fight ing in South Vietnam to protect oil industry interests. Thus far, most Congressmen appear to consider the charges unsubstantiated. The Saigon Government, however, is interested in attracting the oil industry to the area. On industry's side, preliminary seismic studies of offshore Vietnam have labeled it as geo logically “a good risk.” Only two countries in the entire area are producing oil in substan tial commercial quantities—Australia and In donesia. Indonesia, the center of most of the activity, is now producing about 900,000 bar‐ rels a day, almost entirely from onshore wells, but output is expected to climb to more than a million barrels a day this year, with the bulk of the addition coming from offshore wells. In the waters off Burma, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia, the activity is confined to surveys or preliminary drilling. Every Asian nation would like to find oil at home or at least nearby, and this quest has brought Japan, South Korea and Taiwan into con flict over jurisdiction and rights to grant con cessions in certain sections of the East China Sea. Communist China also is interested in oil in the area. United States awareness of this was demonstrated last week when it warned the Gulf Oil Corporation, which has an exploration contract with the Chinese Na tionalists, that it could not protect survey or drilling ships in the disputed areas around the Senkaku Islands.",Archives,,Archives,,[]
