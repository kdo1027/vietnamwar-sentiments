The Screen:'Black on White' Opens at Trans-Lux Houses,1969-10-10,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/10/10/archives/the-screenblack-on-white-opens-at-translux-houses.html,article,"RADLEY METZGER, a tireless promoter of sensationalized sex movies, often with a wisp of artistic camouflage, has scraped a British barrel and come up now with something called ""Black on White."" It opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux West and Trans-Lux East. As entertainment or art, this Technicolor picture is garbage.Purporting to be a flow of subconscious imagery reflecting the emotions of a London girl who is followed across town by a handsome Negro boy, the footage ladles out the daydreams of this pretty, young birdbrain obsessed with one thing.The images range from phallic to explicit, from dull to sickening, as some of the steamier interludes switch to pious utterances against the Vietnamese War and racial prejudice, and documentary glimpses of slaughterhouses and concentration camp victims. Add some sadistic seasoning, such as a shot of a human eyeball slit with a razor. But sex is the main ingredient, and the sound-track musings of Anita Sanders, as the heroine, are idiotic and eventually filthy.The color itself is quite good. The rock 'n' roll score, boinged out by some seedy-looking hippies we first see perched in a tree like a bunch of vultures, is terrible.Ironically, not only are Miss Sanders and Terry Carter attractive young people, but both give evidence of some acting ability, if they're ever able to crawl out from under this mess.The exhibitors of ""Black on White"" themselves have given the import a rating of ""X—persons under 17 cannot be admitted."" Younger moviegoers can take that as a compliment. This time that X means excruciating.",Review,HOWARD THOMPSON,Archives,,[]

Screen: 'Hail Hero!' Weaves a Parable of War:Symbolistic Tale Starts Run at Music Hall Pacifist Plot Is Adapted From Weston Novel,1969-10-24,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/10/24/archives/screen-hail-hero-weaves-a-parable-of-warsymbolistic-tale-starts-run.html,article,"WATCHING new movies these days, I occasionally get the odd feeling that somebody has been tampering with time. Liza Minnelli is the undisputed star of ""The Sterne Cuckoo,"" but the ghost of a youthful Judy Garland, who now seems to have looked very much like Vincente Minnelli, haunts the film in ways that are not at all unpleasant.In ""Hail, Hero!"" you can see Kirk Douglas, even younger than he was in ""The Champion"" in 1949, in the person of his 25-year-old son, Michael. This new Douglas has his father's extraordinary, Fearless Fosdick jaw, the suggestion of his dimpled chin and the cool, gentle eyes. He also possesses the almost manic, physical buoyancy that compels attention even when it bears little relation to the circumstances in which the actor finds himself. It's not an especially memorable performance, but it's an energetic one, and without Douglas, ""Hail, Hero!"" would not even be tolerable.""Hail, Hero!,"" adapted from John Weston's novel, on its surface, is about a flower child who enlists in the Army in order to face and to love the enemy in Vietnam. It is, I suppose, an anti-Vietnam movie, but it's the sort of neutral anti-Vietnam movie that one might expect to find at Radio City Music Hall, where it opened yesterday. This is not meant to knock the Music Hall, or even to imply that the hall has any kind of political bias. It's just that that fine old monument to tourism, art moderne décor and high-kicking has never been known as a citadel of political protest.David Miller, the director, and David Manber, the screenwriter have been unconscionably respectful of Weston's pretentious little novel that preserves the unity of time and place favored by the ancient Greeks. The story, however, owes more to Arthur Miller, on one of his worse days, than it does to Aeschylus.It all takes place on a rich Arizona ranch between one sunup and the next. Carl (Douglas), the younger son of the Dixon clan, has dropped out of his Eastern college and returned home to confront his father (Arthur Kennedy) and older brother, Frank (Peter Strauss), whom he accidentally crippled years before, with the news that he has enlisted.As in Miller's plays, the characters do an awful lot of talking and very little listening, which has always struck me as an especially tiresome theatrical device since the audience has no choice but to listen to everything that is being ignored by the characters.In the novel, Carl's sensitivity was defined by the information that he read Rilke and Beowulf, that he skinny dipped and that he befriended a poor girl named Tinky McSleen, who didn't quite understand Rilke but was moved (if my memory serves) by the sound of the words ""on top of each other.""In the movie, Carl talks long, expository monologues to tombstones and to stuffed mountain lions, tries to express his love for his father who, instead of listening, cuts off his son's hippie hair, and presents his brother with the mummy of an Indian baby whose skull had been cracked.This gift, which is small in size but heavy with symbolism, is offered by the pacifist to his hawk-like brother with the explanation: ""Take a look before you envy my chance to kill.""Along about the middle of what is, in effect, the movie's Act Three, people do start listening to each other. ""What can I give you?"" Frank asks Carl. ""Just touch me,"" says Carl, in one of the film's many curtain lines. Carl spends his last night at home painting the side of his father's barn with a Pop war mural—flowers, bombs, flaming planes and an American flag in which hearts have replaced the stars. In the novel (and in the film before it was recently re-edited), Carl's mother (Teresa Wright) and father joined him in this act of affirmation, which looks more like sentimental lunacy.David Miller, who directed Michael Douglas's father in the equally pretentious but much more stylish ""Lonely Are the Brave,"" never misses an opportunity to state the obvious. This works in his lady-in-distress melodramas (""Midnight Lace,"" ""Sudden Fear""), but it has the effect of turning a genuinely complex situation into a comforting simplistic parable in ""Hail, Hero!""You might say that here, at last, is a movie for dove-like hawks and hawk-like doves. It's enough to make one remember ""The Green Berets"" with fondness.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
