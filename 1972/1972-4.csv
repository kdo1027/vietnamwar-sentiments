Those who came to maturity in the late forties and early fifties hardly think of themselves in terms of a coherent “generation.” Individually, they may feel guilty or lucky because they escaped the horror, but if they think of themselves as a group at all, they do not reach for labels like “tragic,” “heroic” or “lost.” They are a generation without a myth, without an event, without any picturesque image of themselves.

The Screen,1972-04-28,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/28/archives/the-screen.html,article,"Although its producer, David Gil, insists that ""Journey Through Rosebud"" is ""the first totally honest and objective portrait of the contemporary American Indian on film,"" it takes a great deal of wishful interpretation to avoid seeing the movie as an invasion—rather than as an illumination—of a social problem.The film, directed by Tom Gries (who once made a very good, very somber Western called ""Will Penny""), is as well-meaning and boob-brained as its hero, Danny (Kristoffer Tabori), a principled young draft-dodger whom we first see as he wanders lonely as a cloud across a hilltop singing ""America the Beautiful."" He doesn't actually wander. He struts (it seems as if he knows there's a camera near), and he throws up the movie's ironies like a bulldozer plowing through daffodils.Danny, who is looking for sanctuary, hitchhikes into Rosebud, the South Dakota Sioux reservation. He stays around to marvel at their rituals, including the kind of tribal dances that must always look picturesque to the outsider, and to sympathize with their frustrations as represented by Frank (Robert Forster), a young Sioux Vietnam veteran whose life has been pretty much reduced to beer drinking and small gestures of defiance towards the white sheriff and the Indian agent.After one arbitrary thing and another, Danny suddenly finds himself acting like a token offering, the feeble, unwitting victim of an assault that the movie seems to mean as a setting to rights of the massacre at Wounded Knee.Among the few unembarrassing things in the film is the performance by Mr. Forster (""Justine,"" ""Medium Cool""), who is such an easy, unaffected actor that he doesn't look out of place among the large number of real Indians who are in the supporting cast, and whom the camera treats as if they were holy relics. Victoria Racimo, who is pretty and looks faintly Eurasian, plays Forster's former wife, an Indian militant who is required to say things like ""I'm an Indian and I'm going to walk in beauty like the medicine men say.""It is, I suppose, as much a comment on the dopily earnest tone of the film itself, as on the state of socially conscious filmmaking, that much of ""Journey Through Rosebud"" sounds like a parody of Black Consciousness movies and television plays usually made by humorless whites.""Journey Through Rosebud,"" which opened yesterday at the Murray Hill, is described as the first motion picture to be made entirely on an Indian reservation. This information I will file with my list of other firsts, including the fact that Samuel Fuller's ""Hell and High Water"" was the first movie about a submarine ever photographed in Cinema-Scope. Contemporary Indians have been better treated by educational television in documentaries that may or may not have been filmed entirely on the reservation.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

But the Vietnam problem itself remains the same. There have always been only three possibilities. One is military victory. Our side can achieve it only through massacres and risks of international confrontation disproportionate to the importance of the stakes for America's national interest. The second is perpetual American involvement to preserve Saigon. This is bound to breed crisis after crisis indecisively. The third is a negotiated settlement, under our auspices or after our withdrawal. Due to our failure to win, this settlement inevitably would have to come close to Hanoi's demands.",Archives,,Archives,,['Vietnam']

This is a sensitive appreciation of that good, especially the activities of the American Friends Service Committee, their sending medicine to the North Vietnamese and their work in the ghettoes. One need not be entirely taken by this small, unique group to understand that they have genuinely changed the world in a small, unique way.
