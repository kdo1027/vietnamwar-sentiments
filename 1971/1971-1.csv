The Screen:'Last Valley' Recalls a Story of Survival,1971-01-29,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/29/archives/the-screenlast-valley-recalls-a-story-of-survival.html,article,"""The Last Valley"" is a kind of historical movie, a type of adventure drama, a sort of epic, and something of a parable, and it winds up being a bit more boring than is absolutely necessary, considering the possibilities.Experiencing the movie is very much like riding in a big, handsome, old Rolls-Royce that keeps wandering from one side of the road to the other, slipping its gears, speeding up and then suddenly breaking — all because the driver doesn't know where he's going or how fast he wants to get there, although it's apparent he wants to travel in all of the style that money can buy.The driver is James Clavell, the novelist (""King Rat"") and film writer-director (""To Sir, With Love""), who wrote, directed and produced this adaption of J. B. Pick's 1960 novel set against the background of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which was almost an anthology of war.Beginning as a rebellion of Protestant German princes against the Catholic Habsburgs, it evolved, over the decades, into a series of see-saw battles, mixed alliances and desperate power plays involving France, England, Spain, Denmark and Sweden, in addition to Austria and the German states. By the time the Treaty of Westphalia was signed, most of Germany had been devastated and about the only thing that had been accomplished was the irrevocable end of the Holy Roman Empire, which was dead anyway.""The Last Valley"" is a rather dreamlike story of survival set in a magnificent valley protected from the outside world by high mountains. Into this valley comes Vogel (Omar Sharif), a one-time school teacher who has been on the run for years, followed shortly afterwards by a small, exhausted army led by the Captain (Michael Caine), whose men kill and burn and rape on reflex and have long since forgotten what they're fighting for.The Captain, using Vogel as a go-between, effects a truce with the people of the valley, pledging to protect them from invasion in return for food, shelter and women for the winter, at the end of which the Captain goes off to fight another battle and Vogel is evicted, to continue his wanderings. The people of the valley survive, simply by enduring.Like Bertolt Brecht in ""Mother Courage,"" Mr. Clavell, I suspect, sees the incredible horrors of the Thirty Years' War as a metaphor for contemporary horrors, but he seems either incapable of—or uninterested in—developing a physical drama with any kind of intellectual substructure. Vogel, a pragmatic dreamer, and the Captain, a career soldier whose cynicism is not quite complete, talk quite a lot about war and religion but the quality of their dialogue would not embarrass the folks on ""Gunsmoke."" When, in the spring, the Captain departs to engage in yet another battle, the outcome of which will make no difference to anybody, all he can say is that he must go to the battle ""because it's there.""So much money was obviously spent on the lavish production—on scenery, costumes, occasional battles and extras—that I suspect Mr. Clavell thought he was making a statement about civilization, and perhaps even Vietnam, that would somehow work as an action melodrama. Although Mr. Clavell, as a writer, has nothing in common with Shaw, ""The Last Valley"" kept reminding me of Guy Hamilton's misguided attempts some years ago to turn ""The Devil's Disciple"" into a popcorn movie.It's difficult to judge Mr. Clavell's effect on his performers, except to remark that Mr. Sharif and Mr. Caine, who've never struck me as especially subtle actors, are quite good, while Per Oscarsson (""Hunger""), who is, I think, a great actor, seems to be acting up a storm in a dramatic vacuum. It may be, however, that in his make-up as a slightly mad Catholic priest he looks just a little too much like Charles Manson.One technical point: the film, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and Juliet 2 Theaters, favors such slow lap dissolves that you will spend what seems like most of the movie seeing double images.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
