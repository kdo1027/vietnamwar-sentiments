Recent U.S. military actions in Laos and North Vietnam demonstrated our intent to move toward our objectives. Our operations and progress in Laos constitute one step along the route. Our directness and rapidity of reaction, in bombing North Vietnamese installations and deploying U.S. combat forces to Southeast Asia were others. Each step played a part. Their effect was to in terrupt the continually improving Com munist posture, catch the imagination of the Southeast Asian peoples, provide some lift to morale, however temporary, and force CHICOM/DRV assessment or reassessment of U.S. intentions. But these were only steps along the way. What we have not done and must do is make plain to Hanoi and Peiping the cost of pursuing their current objectives and impeding ours. An essential element of our military action in this course is to proceed in the development of our physical readiness posture: deploying troops, ships, aircraft, and logistic re sources in a manner which accords a maximum freedom of action. This is the thrust we should continue to pursue, one which is intended to provide more than one feasible course for considera tion as the changed and changing South east Asian situation develops. Remarks in the paragraphs which follow are sub mitted in light of this assessment and with the view that pressures against the other side once instituted should not be relaxed by any actions or lack of them which would destroy the bene fits of the rewarding steps previously taken in Laos and North Vietnam.",Archives,,Archives,,['Vietnam']

Analysis of the present situation. The situation in South Vietnam is de teriorating. Even before the government sank into confusion last week, the course of the war in South Vietnam had been downward, with Viet Cong incidents in creasing in number and intensity and military actions becoming larger and more successful, and with less and less territory meaningfully under the control of the government. Successful ambushes had demonstrated an unwillingness of the population even in what were thought to be pacified areas to run the risk of informing on the Viet Cong. War weariness was apparent. The crisis of the end of August—especially since the competing forces have left the govern ment largely “faceless” and have dam aged the government's ability to manage the pacification program—promises to lead to further and more rapid deteriora tion. The objective of the United States is to reverse the present down ward trend. Failing that, the alternative objective is to emerge from the situa tion with as good an image as possible in US, allied and enemy eyes.",Archives,,Archives,,['Vietnam']

"Screen: Nicholson's 'Drive, He Said':Movie Marks Actor's Debut as Director Tale of College Athlete Opens at Tower East",1971-06-14,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/14/archives/screen-nicholsons-drive-he-saidmovie-marks-actors-debut-as-director.html,article,"""Drive, He Said,"" loosely adapted by Jeremy Larner and Jack Nicholson from Larner's 1964 Delta Prize novel, and directed by Nicholson (his directorial debut), comes close to being the sort of movie about the anxieties and dilemmas of the sixties that no one ever made in the sixties—which were constantly confused with the more innocent fifties. It is not a great film, but it is an often intelligent one, and it is so much better than all of the rest of the campus junk Hollywood has manufactured in the last couple of years that it can be indulged its sentimental conventions.Specifically, it's about a star college athlete, Hector Bloom, to whom basketball is what boxing is to Private Prewitt what playwriting maybe to Tennessee Williams and what risking an arm or a leg or a life probably is to Peter Gimbel. Like some forms of art, it is, simultaneously, a heightened response to the world, a mystical retreat from it, and a practical way of getting along in it.In the course of his senior year, Hector begins to feel, in his word, disconnected. The old game doesn't quite mean what it once did. He is more than a little surprised to find that he is in love with Olive, the professor's wife with whom he's been having an affair, and he is shocked when the joy of his discovery isn't shared by Olive, who is not so simply pregnant.Hector admires and envies the campus radicals, who are so committed to a cause that they can interrupt a basketball game for an anti-Vietnam demonstration, staged as guerrilla theater. He himself hasn't the faintest idea where he is going or why. When a pro ball club asks him to sign, he demands only that the club improve the quality of the frankfurters it sells to the public, and cut the price from 50c to a quarter.In fact, Hector is so disconnected—at least in terms of the character as written—that it comes as a major surprise, late in the film, to learn that he is a Greek major. This bit of information, which I assume is presented seriously, is as unsettling as learning that someone you thought you knew extremely well is, in reality, one-half of a pair of twins. It means that an important (or, at the least, a time-consuming) part of Hector's life has been kept secret.Also fairly secret is Hector's state of mind, though William Tepper, a tall, dark-haired young man who may or may not have studied the collected works of Dustin Hoffman, defines well enough Hector's individual attitudes of frustration, anger and what might be called romantic campus lassitude. A reading of Larner's novel fills in a lot of these gaps, but otherwise the novel might mislead the filmgoer into expecting satiric fantasy (which the movie never achieves), having to do with unnamed wars (not in Vietnam), with a lot of bizarre characters who might have been created by Waugh, and with middle-class American-Jewish intellectual and social life.One result of this secrecy—perhaps simplification is a better terms—is that most of the other characters in the film, just because they are the supporting characters in the film as well as in Hector's life, are more thoroughly and quickly defined, and thus more vivid and appealing than Hector. I especially liked Karen Black as the besieged Olive, a woman who once might have ben fated to be misunderstood and badly used by men, but who finally liberates herself; Robert Towne, as her husband, who would prefer to dry his beard with an electric comb than wory about cuckoldry; Bruce Dern, as the intensely clean-living coach, and Michael Margotta, who looks like a young Elisha Cook Jr., as Hector's radical roommate whose ultimate act of survival provides the film with its obligatory, if shopworn, irony.Most importantly, al of the film's characters, and all of the performances, are touched with the kind of unexpected sensibility and decency that are rare in most films of this genre. It's a quality that I associate with the performances Nicholson himself gave in both ""Easy Rider"" and ""Five Easy Pieces."" Nicholson not only is good with actors, but he also chooses to avoid most of the visual (and aural) clichés of the day, and when he does indulge himself—as in the fine basketballl sequences—they no longer seem clichés since the rhythm of the sport more or less demands the treatment. I wish I could report that Hector was as interesting as the film that surrounds him.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

Newley's 'Summertree' Opens:Hume and Yafa Work Revisits the 40's Death of a Serviceman Fixes the Action,1971-06-17,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/17/archives/newleys-summertree-openshume-and-yafa-work-revisits-the-40s-death.html,article,"Anybody old enough can remember, and anybody not old enough may imagine, the mood of sentiment about the land and the ordinary people and the quality of tree-shaded life in middle-America that gripped the popular arts, and especially the movies, during and for a few years after World War II. The mood passes—for a good many reasons—by the early 1950's, but a certain nostalgia for it remains. That nostalgia has been felt in several movies recently—movies that mean to recreate the 1940's—and it now appears brought up to date in Anthony Newley's ""Summertree,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters and which attempts indicting the barbarities of Vietnam in terms of decent emotional strategies developed to illustrate life on the home front 30 years ago.I never saw the successful Ron Cowen play upon which ""Summertree"" is based, but I gather there have been a lot of changes—mostly directed toward ""relevance"" and a slight juicing up of the action. There is a new character, a little black boy (Kirk Callaway), who speaks for separatism. And the girl friend (Brenda Vaccaro) is now a somewhat older woman who already has a husband—in Vietnam. But the boy (Michael Douglas) with each toss of his rugged head, each glance from his friendly eyes, bespeaks Young America. And the gruff dad (Jack Warden) who nervously loves his son and finally betrays him into war, and mom who cares and puts on the coffee — they are an older America that appropriately lives for the young. Barbara Bel Geddes plays mom, and one closed-mouth smile of hers is surely worth 350 apple pies cooling in the kitchen window.The central image of the summertree itself — a backyard retreat where the boy goes to dream his life into being—survives in rather ridiculous ways: especially in a bit of tinkly music, and a worm-eaten leaf pattern superimposed on the screen over his first night of lovemaking with the girl friend. And his death, which is in fact the reason for the drama, is there also, as a final bitter irony of the war that the movie, not too stupidly, admits wholly through the medium of the television screen.""Summertree"" is a bad movie, but its badness proceeds not from its intentions, which seem honorable, or from its stylistic analogies to past modes, which in different hands could have been interesting. The badness exists, rather, moment by moment, in the insufficiency of each acted scene, in the niggling insecurity of Newley's camera, in the improverishment of each evocation of a quality of life—from the boy's dull guitar playing, which is supposed to be great, to the father's love of hunting, which should recreate the landscape, but only signifies a thoughtless and cruel pastime.Nobody's performance quite works in ""Summertree,"" but it is possible at least to respect Jack Warden's tense privacies and Michael Douglas's restraint in projecting a youthful goodwill without either petulance or excessive charm. Brenda Vaccaro is reasonable off-type casting, but she does not seem resourceful enough even to explore the limits of this small, appealingly pathetic role.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

The Screen: 'Glory Boy':Violence Is Outcome of Veterans' Return,1971-06-30,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/30/archives/the-screen-glory-boyviolence-is-outcome-of-veterans-return.html,article,"Some movies, often the very greatest, are genuinely difficult. Some others, never the greatest, are merely obscure. It is in this second category, films that by their own confusions and inadequacies fail to make the kind of sense they so unclearly intend, that Edwin Sherin's ""Glory Boy,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Forum theaters, belongs.""Glory Boy"" is yet another movie made not about, but under the shadow of, the Vietnam War. When its young hero (Michael Moriarty) returns home to his father's run-down farm north of San Francisco, he brings with him a stupid but relatively harmless Army buddy (William Devane) and a Regular Army sergeant (Mitchell Ryan) who is more or less waiting put his 30 days before re-enlisting.The sergeant is no friend, merely somebody picked up because his stern jaw, his medals and his military manner will please the old man. But behind his tough exterior seethes a soul of sulfuric acid, and after he has humiliated dad, knocked unconscious a hitchhiking college girl (Topo Swope) so as to rape her, and dynamited the fish in the trout stream, it becomes fairly obvious that he is a one-man social, moral and ecological disaster.Between the father (Arthur Kennedy) and the sergeant there is a certain equivalence, for the old man has in gentler ways ruined everything he has touched (so you shouldn't miss the point, he keeps praising the farm as a Garden of Eden) and he too represents the militarism of an age—the age of World War II. The film recognizes that the two wars are not equal—the father is fallen from sentimental ideals; the sergeant is pure evil force—but symbolically and, at last, literally, the two cancel each other out.I think this is the most significant action in ""Glory Boy,"" though there are several others, and there is a whole household full of representative types—including the girl who, unaccountably, comes back to cook and clean and put flowers on the dining room table. But except for what fits together all too neatly, nothing seems to belong with anything else, and it all feels like watching a series of strung-together three-minute sketches. Sherin's direction stresses action in the middle distance not all that bad, but limiting and the multiplication of pregnant pauses — so that sometimes it looks as though the actors really are standing around wondering what to do next.Almost everybody figures out something reasonable in time—except for William Devane, who plays for a kind of instant insanity and ends up suggesting, say, Jerry Lewis as Macbeth. But the two principle kids, Michael Moriarty and Topo Swope, really are something special—appealing without courting appeal, sympathetic without the production of any unnecessary charm. Michael Moriarty particularly brings a rather intricate intelligence to an almost incomprehensible role. But both he and Miss Swope introduce a quality I should never have expected in this movie—a quality of articulate and active lucidity.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
