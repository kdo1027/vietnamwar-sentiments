The Edge' Begins Run,1968-03-28,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/03/28/archives/the-edge-begins-run.html,article,"ROBERT KRAMER, a man who obviously believes in political engagement, takes a strangely oblique—and in many ways disturbing—look at the not-so-new-left in ""The Edge,"" his second feature film but his first to receive commercial release.This spare, talky but often provocative film does not focus on the doers, the organizers, but generally on the dropouts from activtism and specifically on one young man. He believes he can become re-engaged only by committing a completely irrational act: He plans to kill the President of the United States.The picture, written and directed by the 27-year-old Mr. Kramer, opened here yesterday at the New Cinema Playhouse, the underground cinema's first-run Manhattan showcase.The theme of the film is stated by the one character in the movie who has not yet been totally neutralized by his frustrations.This young man, a former civil rights worker who is rather half-heartedly planning to organize a campus draft resistance movement, says at one point:""I know there's a war going on and I know it's bad, but I don't know how to take what I believe and make something happen.""That's also the cry of America's would-be-committed middle class, which, intentionally or not, is the group Mr. Kramer is making his film about.His characters—Village intellectuals, artists, sometimes activists and their wives and mistresses—are all comparatively fat cats. Their pads, for the most part, are sleazily typical—sling chairs, lumpy looking beds and cardboard coffee containers for ash trays—but nobody is activated by a need as basic as hunger. Rather, they seem to be anesthetized as much by boredom and their own basic affluence as by the paradoxes of the contemporary war-peace society.This, it seems to me, is the only way to explain the utter lethargy that greets the announcement of one of their friends that he plans to kill the President to atone for the killing in Vietnam. Some attempts are made to talk the assassin out of his plan, and even he agrees that it is senseless. But his friends do nothing to prevent the act, either to save their friend—who seems to have flipped over the edge of sanity—or their own causes, to say nothing of preventing a rather superfluous murder in Washington.Although Mr. Kramer's intellectual approach is oblique, his film style is nothing if not frontal. He snoots in an economical, cinema vérité manner, in the apartments, on the streets, on the highways, on the beaches and in the countryside. His characters talk almost constantly, sometimes on camera, sometimes only on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the latter is often fuzzy, but this has its own authenticity. So does much of the dialogue, even at its most puerile, and the grainy black-and-white photography.The actors, none of whom are well known, do not so much act as appear as the embodiments of various attitudes and positions. Most prominent are Jack Rader, as the ill-fated assassin, destined, of course, to fail; Tom Griffin, as the young man who continues, doggedly, to work as an organizer, and Paul Hultberg, as the comparatively settled—he has wife and child—guru of this cell of lost revolutionists.""The Edge"" is not poetic. Rather it is noteworthy as one of the few examples of underground cinema totally committed to the social-political scene.",Review,VINCENT CANBY,Archives,,[]
