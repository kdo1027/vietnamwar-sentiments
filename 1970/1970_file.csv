At Princeton, Herman Steven son, the track team cap tain, called for a boycott of Saturday's Heptagonal Games, and at Dartmouth, Steve Tourek, the crew captain, urged oarsmen to wear black headbands in Saturday's Eastern Sprint championships as a symbol of mourning for the Kent State dead. In a letter to rival crew captain. Tourek wrote: “The question should not be to row or not to row but how to make meaningful our feelings. We can accom plish more by competing and by showing our commitment to what is happening in the world divorced from crew.”",Archives,By Robert Lipsyte,Archives,,[]

If you can't quite bring into reasonable approximation the rhetoric of Mr. Nixon and the reality of Southeast Asia? If you choose three to five years in prison instead of killing Vietnamese? As Dr. Willard Gaylin says, “This was a politically volatile subject, war re sistance; in a soci ologically vulner able area, the prisons; conduct ed by a question ably respectable researcher, a psy choanalyst.” Wrong. At least on the last count: Kenneth Keniston, Robert Coles, Rob ert Jay Lifton and, of course, Erik Erikson stack up as a library that— for respectability, intelligence and pertinence—mazes most recent sociology look like comic books written by computers. Dr. Gaylin belongs on their shelf. At some length, over a con siderable period of time, he interviewed young men who refused induction into our armed services; who chose instead to go to jail. In the process, he learned a great deal not only about prisons and the draft, but also about himself. A significant “counter‐transference” occurred, leading him to ask crucial questions about psycho analytic theory and therapeutic practice, as well as the war.",Archives,By John Leonard,Archives,,['Vietnam']

IF and when the world ends, I wouldn't be at all surprised if there weren't at least two or three American movie companies willing to bid for the distri bution rights, on the outside chance that the cataclysm might turn out to be a good show, as well as something less than total. One of the most impressive things about the just‐ended 23d Inter national Cannes Film Festival was the apparent enthusiasm of American film people to merchandise national disas ter. Sometimes this was simply a coincidence, as when Stuart Hagmann's “The Strawberry Statement,” a drama of campus unrest that has a brutal police riot as its climax, was shown here the day after the news came in from Kent, Ohio. Sometimes it seemed more self‐conscious, more self‐serving. The direc tor of “Woodstock,” Michael Wadleigh, a handsome young man who wears his hair in a long, Christ‐like bob, and his associates passed out black arm bands at the screening of their film, which they an nounced was being dedicated to the four students “who were killed by U.S. troops while manifesting their oppo sition to the Vietnam and Cambodian wars.” Unfortu nately, this gesture, no mat ter how sincere, followed a lot of conventional, high pressure publicity organized on behalf of the film by War ner Brothers, the distributor, and thus suggested oppor tunism, at least to members of the press corps. Warners had celebrated the film's ap pearance here by, among other things, passing out “Wood stock” headbands and lapel pins (the sort of things that are printed to order on 42d Street), bringing in a couple of bus loads of American students from Aix‐en‐Pro vence to carry antiwar ban ners in a small “manifesta tion,” by staging a rock con cert on the beach and by throwing a hippie‐style party that had, I'm told; a couple of the most elegant of the local couturiers working overtime. “I think,” said one French producer, “that War ners did everything but plant a bomb in the festival palace.”",Archives,By Vincent CanBY,Archives,,[]

Screen: A Plastic Garden:Don Johnson Portrays 'Stanley Sweetheart',1970-05-27,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/27/archives/screen-a-plastic-gardendon-johnson-portrays-stanley-sweetheart.html,article,"Stanley Sweetheart, a junior at Columbia, lost his virginity at 16, wears his hair discreetly long and has the kind of trouble with girls that a liberated Henry Aldrich might have. After a very earnest campaign, he succeeds in deflowering one of Grosse Pointe's prettiest and dimmest candidates for higher education. Later, he himself is seduced by her ravenous, overweight roommate (while starring her in an underground movie called ""Masturbation""). Depending on the way you regard such things, Stanley finally hits bottom, or top, when he winds up in an East Village ménage à trois with two extremely cheerful (and flexible) Lesbians.Stanley is a role-player—basically innocent. ""The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart"" isn't.It peers and peeks more than any average Russ Meyer movie, and it talks dirtier than just about any commercial movie that I can remember. Its camera swings and there is a lot of rock music on the soundtrack. However, like so many other places of expensive, modish, retail merchandise, it remains calculatingly bland, with no more wit or point of view than ""Search for Tomorrow,"" although it occasionally takes a reproving, almost motherly look at the dirty dishes, the piled-up garbage and empty beer cans that litter Stanley's apartment.The film, which opened yesterday at the Paris Theater, was adapted for the screen by Robert T. Westbrook from his own quite funny, reportedly semi-autobiographical novel. Although the novel was not specifically dated in time, it was apparently meant to be more or less contemporary.The novel's Stanley is not a political animal (the book makes no attempt to cover the Columbia riots of 1968), but its Stanley is facing Vietnam and, in one of Stanley's nicest, Mittyesque moments, he commits himself to non-commitment by tearing up his draft card and sending it off to his draft board with a letter that starts: ""I've been watching your ugly, stupid viciousness on TV for long enough. . . .""In spite of the fact that the movie's Stanley goes to the real-life Columbia (the film was photographed entirely in New York), there is no draft and no Vietnam. There is only a terrible feeling of déjà vu about the life styles it does cover. Underground movies were funny about seven or eight years ago, and Don Johnson plays Stanley as if he were imitating Marlon Brando, who was imitable 20 years ago. Stanley's encounters with women seem not to be patterned on life as much as on movies like ""Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers."" Women rampant leave him exhausted, and exhaustion, more than anything else, is the basis of his sentimental education.Of the women in the film, two are memorable: Dianne Hull, who manages to act the role of a sweet, dull girl without ever being dull, and Holly Near, who plays a big fat girl with the unfinished facial features of an irritable 6-year-old and the sexual hungers of Catherine of Russia. The film is the first theatrical feature directed by Leonard Horn, who comes from television where, among other things, he directed segments of ""Mannix"" and ""Mission: Impossible."" He's been a bad boy and someone should take away his zoom lens.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

With no recognizable landmark further north than Cooper Square, it nevertheless feels like Bronxville or the quieter stretches of the upper East Side.Not that it aspires to quietness or that it even for a second eschews relevancy. One major portion (for me, the best portion) depicts an all-black play production, ""Be Black, Baby,"" in which the cast, in white face, mingles with, steals from, and finally beats and rapes the white liberal audience. And the hero, a young Vietnam veteran, moves from filthy picture-taking to middle-class apartment house bombing, partly in an effort to achieve total involvement—which, in the terms of this film, seems necessarily to include a final solution.But the eager hero (Robert De Niro) and the over-eager heroine (Jennifer Salt, the major interest of the flashbacks in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" revealed as a fine comedienne here) are so clean-cut; the second leads, white and black, so epitomize attractive youth; and the supporting cast, as in many Brian De Palma movies, could so handsomely model a panoramic painting of the Rape of the Seven Sister Colleges; that an air of tasteful respectability pervades even the outrageous violence. As if they were making bombs on West 11th Street.""Hi, Mom!"" turns approximately every other current social misery to a comedy that is sometimes quite elabborately successful and sometimes only well intentioned. As in De Palma's previous ""Greetings,"" the humor, at its best, is understated but highly structured—so that you have to work a bit for your laughs. But ""Hi, Mom!"" is much sharper, crueler, funnier. Although it scatters some shots (often in a kind of fast-motion photography that seems an addiction of De Palma's) it pulls enough together to suggest some major insights, as it investigates the militarization and despoliation of Washington Square South.But it is the minor insights that most happily remain: the white black-power activist (Gerrit Graham) who for a second demurs before painting his body entirely black; the pornographic-movie impresario (Allen Garfield) who wants to make ""the first children's exploitation film—nothing dirty, nothing smutty;"" or the mere idea of the TV show that chronicles the opening night of ""Be Black, Baby!"" A production of National Intellectual Television, it is called ""N.I.T. Journal,"" which, (to my mind, comes under the category of what oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed.",Review,,Archives,,[]

Screen: The Pilgrimage of Martin Luther King Jr.,1970-03-24,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/24/archives/screen-the-pilgrimage-of-martin-luther-king-jr.html,article,"""KING,"" an account of the public career of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. compiled and edited from several kinds of documentary footage by Ely Landau, is scheduled to play tonight only at many theaters throughout the country, including more than 50 in the boroughs of New York City. A longer version of the film will eventually be available for purposes of study, but for most moviegoers the theatrical version, which runs for almost three hours, may well seem long enough.In fact it is too long, exactly to the extent that it includes a number of cameo guest appearances by such stars as Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster, James Earl Jones and others who mostly look at the camera and very sincerely recite verse. But the rest of ""King,"" except for a few relevant national-affairs stock shots (Vietnam; Lyndon Johnson's Civil Rights bill), sticks close to its subject, and for its pains achieves a density and shapeliness that is rare in any movie—let alone a documentary committed to the sequence of actual events.Those events begin with the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, when Dr. King was 27 years old, and they end shortly after his murder in Memphis, in April, 1968. Between, come the confrontations in Birmingham, the 1963 March on Washington, the three Selma voter-registration marches, the housing protests in Chicago, and finally the Memphis sanitation men's strike, which led to Dr. King's death. Even from this short distance, it is good to be reminded of recent history, and what that history, as it generates pride or even mere dramatic urgency, owes to black men in America.Although it makes some attempt to distinguish Dr. King and his nonviolence from the black militants who came after him, and although the distinction is accurate, the film strongly suggests the continuity of Dr. King and his successors in a drive toward a viable group identity. Dr. King's strategies, seen here in rich and spacious detail, seem to have been designed less for winning civil rights as such than for the use of civil rights as a means to human dignity. In Dr. King's platform and pulpit manner (of which there is a good deal) that bid follows a traditional Christian rhetoric for which religious belief and self-dramatization go hand in hand. The manner seems flamboyant, and a little old-fashioned. But it was a real form of communication, and for a while it worked.When it begins not to work, after the fire hoses of Birmingham have been replaced by the lawn sprinklers of Chicago, it strains toward a sense of fulfillment (with many quotations from ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"") that really does seem hollow. The film catches this shift with great precision and insight, just as it faithfully records only only bitter victories (for example, the Birmingham jail) but also victorious-seeming defeats (for example, the descent of the celebrities for the end of the third Selma march: a Nichols and May comedy routine, Harry Belafonte singing about the girl in Kingston Town.)But the truth of ""King"" is ultimately a ceremonial truth, of symbolic gestures, crowds, surging response. I know nothing to compare it with except Leni Riefenstahl's magnificent ""Triumph of the Will""—not, of course, in tone or content, but rather in its comprehension of history as drama. But ""Triumph of the Will"" was history staged for the camera, and ""King"" is history understood by the camera. ""King"" attempts no analysis. It raises reportage to the power of ritual, and for all its lapses it is a most solemnly beautiful film.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

In what used to be normal times, this was natural enough. Before World War II, the peacetime military establishment was small and com posed entirely of regulars—a caste that tended to be distinct from the rest of the population. Its officers came from West Point or Annapolis, married the daughters of other regu lars and sent their sons to West Point or Annapolis. Enlisted men got drunk on payday and drunker at the expira tion of every hitch, after which they staggered back to the post and re enlisted. When they landed in the brig or guardhouse, which was fre quently, the civilian public cared about the fairness of the proceedings no more than it cared about the system of criminal justice applicable to other foreigners, such as Chinese coolies. Neither the Supreme Court nor anyone else ever supposed that the Bill of Rights applied to soldiers. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase said in 1867 that “the power of Congress in the government of the land and naval forces ... is not at all affected by the Fifth or any other amend ment,” and the proposition was scarcely challenged until after World War II.",Archives,By Joseph W.

But it had already initiated unilaterally its policy of partition and of imposing Diem upon the south. Disregarding the Conference accords, the will of the Viet namese, its own pledge and the U.N. Charter, it has persisted right up to the present in trying to disrupt Vietnam's territorial integrity and to yoke the south with unsavory, unpopular re‐gimes. The absence of enforcement powers does not exempt na tions from the obligations of international law, nor does it modify the criminal character of our war in Vietnam as juridi cally defined at Nuremberg. Moreover, the lawlessness of U.S. behavior in Indochina does not place Mr. Nixon in a posi tion to exhort Americans to respect law at home.

Movies:His Happiness Is A Thing Called 'Joe',1970-08-02,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/02/archives/movieshis-happiness-is-a-thing-called-joe.html,article,"THERE he was as big as a Mack truck—""Joe""—standing on the stoop of his West 79th Street brownstone, dressed entirely in black, his bald pate gleaming under the mid-morning sun. His name is really Peter Boyle, and he's a 34-year-old former Christian Brother from Philadelphia. But it's hard to think of him as anyone but ""Joe"" after seeing his sensational performance as the gun-loving, beer-swilling, tough-talking tool-and-die maker from Queens who hates ""niggers,"" hippies and fags, and not necessarily in that order. Peter is such a good ""Joe,"" in fact, that columnists are already touting him for the 1970 Oscar as best actor. And even those critics who jumped on ""Joe"" raved about Peter's performance.Peter is waiting outside his building, he says, because he doesn't want any stranger to see his sparsely furnished (TV, two chairs, a ""Joe"" poster, a bed) bachelor apartment. So he decides in his rather assertive manner (""I'm really very shy"") that we will walk down Broadway and get some breakfast at a neighborhood greasy spoon. Peter is stopped several times along the way, and it is obvious by his reactions that he loves the recognition. Well, the guy deserves it. It's taken him 10 years of odd jobs, two-bit roles and ""tough guy"" commercials to get it.""Hi, Joe!"" a shaggy-haired youth shouts in passing. ""Loved your movie."" ""Thanks,"" the grinning actor replies, proudly hoisting his slightly pot-bellied, 220-pound frame up to its full 6-feet-2-inches. At 77th and Broadway, where a scene for Woody Allen's new movie, ""Bananas,"" is being filmed, a red-haired woman extra rushes up to Peter and kisses him on the cheek. ""Oh, you were wonderful!"" she squeals. ""Thanks, Naomi."" On the edge of the crowd, a handsome black actor pumps Peter's hand and says, ""Hey, man, do you remember me from that beer commercial in Pittsburgh? You wore my orange sweatshirt."" Peter remembers, and they talk about old times.Peter chooses a coffee shop at 75th and Broadway, and after ordering ham and eggs, he begins talking about the ""incredible timing"" of ""Joe."" At first his tone is matter-of-fact, but as he goes on, it becomes somber, disconsolate.""We finished it last February, and that was way before Kent State or Jackson State or the construction workers beating up on the kids on Wall Street. Mylai had happened, of course, and I think the last scene in ""Joe,"" where the kids are murdered in the commune, may have been inspired by that massacre. But none of us were prophetic—none of us knew that the hardhats were going to do what they did on Wall Street. The minute I heard about it, I knew it was going to affect the way the movie was received. I wasn't happy . . . who could be happy about that? If anything, I'm scared. I've been scared for a couple of years. I get scared when I meet people like Joe. And I get scared when I hear that kids are standing up at the end of the movie and yelling. 'I'm going to shoot back, Joe.' In fact, the other night I was walking down 46th Street and I had a flash of myself being shot down in the street, just because someone thought I really was Joe.""Peter pauses for a moment, plucks eight pills in assorted colors of red, white and brown — ""all vitamins,"" he says—from his shirt pocket, and gulps them down with orange juice.""The message of the movie is very plain,"" he goes on. ""It says that we'd just better stop that war in Vietnam now; that we'd just better stop killing our children there or we're going to be killing our children in the streets here. The Bible says that if you live by the sword, you die by the sword, and that's what's going to happen.""Politically speaking, Peter says he is probably best described as a ""conservative radical."" ""I got that from Norman Mailer,"" he says, ""and I like it, although I did not support Mailer for Mayor. I did not want to encourage such excesses of megalomania."" Peter traces his ""leftward leanings"" to Chicago in the summer of 1968, when he was acting at Second City at the time the Democratic convention was going on.""One night I was standing peacefully with some friends in front of a bar in Old Town,"" he recalls, ""and some cops started chasing us. An Episcopal clergyman picked us up in his car, and gave us sanctuary in his house. I remember saying, 'My God, I'm in America, and I'm afraid for my life!' I'm always ready for a fight at any time, but quite frankly, I didn't want my face beaten in just then because I had acting jobs. On another night I was just sitting in my apartment on Schiller Street and I was tear-gassed. At first I thought it was a sneeze coming on, so I took a vitamin C tablet. Then I discovered it was tear gas wafting down from Lincoln Park where the kids were getting gassed.""Despite it all, Peter says he is not entirely unsympathetic with ""Joe."" ""He's a man who's really trapped,"" he says. ""He doesn't like his job, his taxes are sky high, and his kids are causing him trouble at home. Sometimes I worry that maybe we were too hard on him. He is lovable in his own way. But then I get to thinking how scary it is that the hardhats are becoming activists, and it reminds me of the brownshirts in Germany during the thirties. The hardhats say they're patriotic, but their unions are the most notoriously racist of all the unions. If that's who's representing patriotism in our country, then we're really in trouble.""Peter wasn't the first choice for ""Joe."" He read for the part three times and was told he was ""marvelous—but too young,"" so an older, more experienced actor was selected. He didn't work out, and Peter was called in after production had begun to take over the role. He was paid a total of $2,520 for six weeks' work.""At the tryouts, I improvised instead of reading the script they gave me,"" he says, ""because I had been hearing that character all my life. In Philly, where I grew up, people all around me were spouting off about 'those damn niggers, and people on welfare, and wops, and kikes.' I did the same type of character at Second City, and I knew the character so well that when it came to the actual shooting of the movie, I was worried that I would do a caricature.""""Joe"" is not his first movie, but it is the first one he has made a splash in. He was an extra in ""The Group,"" and played the man who ran the gun range in ""Medium Cool."" Peanuts, as far as money goes, but he managed to support himself fairly well doing commercials for TWA (he was the baggage handler), Buick (he was a customer) and Instant Replay (he was a baseball catcher who caught ""the best pitcher in baseball—Tom Seaver""). He has a small part in a group therapy scene in the upcoming ""Diary of a Mad Housewife,"" which he did after ""Joe"" was completed. ""David Gill [""Joe's"" producer] told me I was crazy to do that bit with 'Joe' coming up. I said, 'Look, I don't have any idea what's going to happen to 'Joe.'""Breakfast is over. We walk up Broadway and into Riverside Park, where Peter straddles a park bench. Curly black hair shows beneath his unbuttoned shirt, and he looks so rough, tough and ugly-handsome that he reminds one of Rod Steiger . . . no, Telly Savalas . . . no, the late William Bendix, Or better yet, a mixture of the three, Machismo.It's not surprising, then, that his acting idol is Marlon Brando. ""He's the best,"" Peter declares. ""I had this fantasy of meeting him the other day. Frankly, I'd be a little scared of meeting him. I mean, what would I say?""Peter was born in Philadelphia to Irish immigrant parents. His late father, whose professional name was Pete Boyle, was a commercial artist who later hosted children's shows on a TV station there. Mrs. Boyle now lives in New York with one of Peter's two sisters.Peter became a Christian Brother while a student at La Salle College, but he left the order soon after graduation. ""My name was Brother Francis,"" he recalls, ""and I prayed so hard I had callouses on my knees. I tried to reach God, I did a lot of studying, and I found it was an unnatural way to live. The celibacy is ridiculous. Boy, I really got horny.""I'm really into a Zen thing now,"" he goes on, lying down on his back on the park bench. ""I just don't like the authoritarianism of the Catholic Church. And I don't like the materialism I see in the parishes, with their concern for money and building larger and larger schools. But there are some very exciting people in the church now, like Father Berrigan.""The next stop after the monastery was the U. S. Navy, where Peter was discharged after a few months of service because of a ""severe nervous breakdown."" Then he headed for New York, with dreams of becoming an actor. He took lessons from Uta Hagen, worked in the Post Office and as a bouncer at O'Neals' pub, toured in the national company of ""The Odd Couple,"" and finally hit pay dirt in the television commercial world.Although he has nothing in the works right now, he says he hopes his next job will be another movie. ""You can improvise in the movies. I know, I know, the screenwriters will pull out their hair when they read that. They're all overpaid, anyway. When people first started making movies, the actors improvised. Charlie Chaplin improvised.""Peter improvised some of the dialogue in ""Joe,"" including one line of his lone nude scene where he makes love to a hippie girl. ""I really felt uptight about that scene,"" he says. ""For one thing, I weighed 10 pounds more than I do now. Anyway, I take her breast in my mouth and she says, 'Hey, wait a minute.' Well, I ad-libbed. 'I hope I'm not out of line,' and they left it in.""Does he worry about being typecast as a Silent Majority man?""It's a danger. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. But I think I can do other things. I remember once going up for it part, and the woman said, 'You don't look menacing enough.' This summer I'm in the CBS Comedy Tonight show [Sundays at 9 P.M.], and I took that so I could show people I could do other things, too."" (If you don't recognize him on the show, that's probably because he'll be wearing his hair-piece.)Although Peter has been ""reasonably close to marriage once or twice,"" he is wary because he has seen so many unhappy marriages among his friends. ""I know that if I'd gotten married when I came out of the monastery, I would probably be getting a divorce by now. Being a bachelor has its points. By the time you're 34, you've really been through a lot of things with women, and you know what you don't want. What I want is children. I think a man and woman who live together and have children are very courageous.""It is noon and Peter has an appointment with a photographer, so we walk back to his building. I leave him as I found him, standing on the stoop and guarding the door because he is ashamed of having a stranger see his bare apartment.Judging from the long lines of people queued up to see ""Joe,"" Peter probably won't he ashamed much longer.",Review,By Judy Klemesrud,Archives,,[]

Brought together overseas by a wary Army command, these five super-tough civilians include two veterans of Vietnam. Their mission is to rescue a Presidential adviser held captive in a remote village.""The Losers,"" opening yesterday on the circuits, has a good idea with some fine, ironic possibilities. And sure enough, this low-budget enterprise uses a slam-bang, blood-dripping massacre of a climax, spearheaded by these hardies, to stress the seeming futility of the war. The film also falls all over itself along the way in dawdling admiration of the bone-crushing quintet as symbols of rebellion.For a full hour — and we timed it — the recruits slam around an outpost town in typical cyclist-movie style, brawling, drinking and anchoring to the local brothel. Watching them cynically, unlike the camera, is a tough-talking Army captain, played by that excellent Negro actor, Bernie Hamilton, who finally gets them — and the show—on the road.Two sideline romances extend right to the front, with the secret-mission truck also carrying two girl friends, and we're not kidding. One of them, as a native girl with a Negro baby from the bordello, is beautifully played by a young Philippine actress named Ana Korita. Her stunned moment of reunion with the captain, who had deserted her, is the only genuinely touching thing in the picture.As for that climactic rescue, the boys roar into the thatched-hut village for an explosive holocaust, with blood flying, quite literally, at the slow-motion camera. The liberated ""Presidential adviser"" turns out to be a cringing, snapping man in a white-linen suit who denounces his burly rescuers as ""trash,"" and leaves two of them to die—all five do. He then barks to the captain: ""Now get me back to Washington so I can straighten out this mess.""On one count, this project shows solid pluck. It was filmed entirely in the Philippines by an independent outfit called Fanfare. The exotic settings, stamped with harshly colored photography, look authentic every inch of the way. There is also evidence that the strapping William Smith, as the brightest of the five, can act. But the scenario by Alan Caillou and the limber direction of Jack Starrett (who also plays the Washingtonian) seem mainly concerned with one thing. War or no war, you can't push these guys around.",Review,By Howard Thompson,Archives,,[]

Screen: Eldridge Cleaver in Algiers,1970-08-25,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/25/archives/screen-eldridge-cleaver-in-algiers.html,article,"""Eldridge Cleaver,"" which opened, without warning, at Cinema II yesterday, is a generally intelligent, wholly sympathetic treatment of the thoughts and personality of Eldridge Cleaver in exile in Algiers. Its apparent aim is not so much to study Cleaver as to provide access to his thoughts and his voice, but in doing this it necessarily does study him. Insofar as Cleaver is the subject, the film is thoughtful, ironic, valuable. Insofar as Johnson, Reagan, Nixon, Agnew and the ""crimes of American imperialism"" are the subjects, the film is very tired and very ordinary propaganda.Directed by William Klein (""Mr. Freedom,"" ""Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee,"" an episode of ""Far From Vietnam""), the film consists at its best of interviews with and scenes from Cleaver's Algerian exile. It includes excellent footage of the First Pan-African Cultural Festival, at which Cleaver spoke, and material from Vietnam, from protest marches and beatings in the United States. It is divided into thought-segments introduced by titles (for example, ""Culture Is a Gun"") flashed on the screen, in the manner of some recent Jean-Luc Godard propaganda movies.However, ""Eldridge Cleaver"" is sufficiently unassertive in its approach to the man to allow his mind and what he has to say essential control—to a degree, even undercutting the more strident rhetoric of some of its images. As he discusses the revolutionary aims and methods of the Panthers, contemplates exile (with rather too desultory a subjective camera exploring the alleys of Algiers), meets African nationalists, laments the captivity in Babylon (the United States) — he emerges as a man of considerable wit, grace, personal sadness and hard-headed realism.Although he advocates an orthodox revolutionary toughness (""So far as I'm concerned, the neutrals are part of the problem.""), he rejects black racism in favor of an internationalism of the oppressed that, if short on analysis, is also short on the appeals to anti-American paranoia that seem so often to motivate ""third-world"" indignation.At one point, Cleaver is shown visiting the North Vietnam delegation in Algiers. Through an interpreter he exchanges friendly views. And before he leaves he poses for Klein's camera, holding hands with the Vietnamese, whom he dwarfs but with whom he seems formally at ease. It is a moment of shy warmth and slightly awkward good feeling, and it is not too atypical of the best film-making in ""Eldridge Cleaver.""",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

Screen: Allusive 'WUSA':Newman Stars in Tale About Radio Station,1970-11-02,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/02/archives/screen-allusive-wusanewman-stars-in-tale-about-radio-station.html,article,"Booze in his thermos, a garment bag slung over his shoulder, out of the morning strolls Paul Newman, itinerant radio announcer, to offer his services to WUSA, patriotic hate station broadcasting from New Orleans.To Newman comes Joanne Woodward, a wandering harlot with a heart of gold, a loving nature, a carved-up face, a certain vulnerability, and a fund of moral rectitude deep enough to float a generation of movie whores. And to them both comes Tony Perkins, shy social worker engaged among the black poor in a mysterious research project—which he learns too late is a fraud designed to discredit welfare, a fraud perpetrated by Pat Hingle, power-mad master of WUSA.Thus Stuart Rosenberg's ""WUSA,"" which opened yesterday at the Penthouse and Plaza theaters, sets the stage for what it clearly intends as a major understanding of social forces at work in America—reactionary social forces, and in the South.If it were an ordinary bad movie (and it is a very bad movie), ""WUSA"" might, in spite of the distinguished names, and less distinguished presence, of its leading actors, be dismissed with no more than a nod to the tension between Rosenberg's ponderously emphatic direction, and Robert Stone's ponderously allusive screenplay. I suspect Stone wins out, for ""WUSA"" feels more like poor theater than poor moviemaking—so, that it continually suggests a failed version of ""The Balcony,"" even though it strives to fall short of ""The Manchurian Candidate.""But at least in its ambitions, ""WUSA"" is not an ordinary bad movie. For in its climax, a huge white-power rally sponsored by WUSA, it means to hold a mirror up to middle America, to show the hate behind the innocence, the chaos implicit in the call to law and order.So, while Perkins stalks the auditorium catwalks with high-powered rifle, like the shade of Laurence Harvey (who is also in this movie, but in another role), Newman prepares to purge himself, to tell the country what it is like it is, when all hell breaks loose after the firing of the would-be assassin's bullet.In this sequence, during which Newman explains Vietnam to a panic-ridden, rioting mass of the thin-lipped pinch-faced silent majority, ""WUSA"" has its crucial image, and, presumably, its rational. But in this sequence it displays most brazenly the utter gratuitousness of all its images, the bad faith that informs its self-righteous view of Southern demagoguery, the poverty not of mainstream America but of its own ideas about mainstream America.Despite its obsession with collecting evidence, and its handy school of pseudo-documentary, ""WUSA"" fights unreal battles with an unseen enemy. Lacking either the grace of art of the vitality of guerrilla theater, it can offer only the coarsest nourishment—and only to the elaborately self-deceived.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
