Movies:His Happiness Is A Thing Called 'Joe',1970-08-02,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/02/archives/movieshis-happiness-is-a-thing-called-joe.html,article,"THERE he was as big as a Mack truck—""Joe""—standing on the stoop of his West 79th Street brownstone, dressed entirely in black, his bald pate gleaming under the mid-morning sun. His name is really Peter Boyle, and he's a 34-year-old former Christian Brother from Philadelphia. But it's hard to think of him as anyone but ""Joe"" after seeing his sensational performance as the gun-loving, beer-swilling, tough-talking tool-and-die maker from Queens who hates ""niggers,"" hippies and fags, and not necessarily in that order. Peter is such a good ""Joe,"" in fact, that columnists are already touting him for the 1970 Oscar as best actor. And even those critics who jumped on ""Joe"" raved about Peter's performance.Peter is waiting outside his building, he says, because he doesn't want any stranger to see his sparsely furnished (TV, two chairs, a ""Joe"" poster, a bed) bachelor apartment. So he decides in his rather assertive manner (""I'm really very shy"") that we will walk down Broadway and get some breakfast at a neighborhood greasy spoon. Peter is stopped several times along the way, and it is obvious by his reactions that he loves the recognition. Well, the guy deserves it. It's taken him 10 years of odd jobs, two-bit roles and ""tough guy"" commercials to get it.""Hi, Joe!"" a shaggy-haired youth shouts in passing. ""Loved your movie."" ""Thanks,"" the grinning actor replies, proudly hoisting his slightly pot-bellied, 220-pound frame up to its full 6-feet-2-inches. At 77th and Broadway, where a scene for Woody Allen's new movie, ""Bananas,"" is being filmed, a red-haired woman extra rushes up to Peter and kisses him on the cheek. ""Oh, you were wonderful!"" she squeals. ""Thanks, Naomi."" On the edge of the crowd, a handsome black actor pumps Peter's hand and says, ""Hey, man, do you remember me from that beer commercial in Pittsburgh? You wore my orange sweatshirt."" Peter remembers, and they talk about old times.Peter chooses a coffee shop at 75th and Broadway, and after ordering ham and eggs, he begins talking about the ""incredible timing"" of ""Joe."" At first his tone is matter-of-fact, but as he goes on, it becomes somber, disconsolate.""We finished it last February, and that was way before Kent State or Jackson State or the construction workers beating up on the kids on Wall Street. Mylai had happened, of course, and I think the last scene in ""Joe,"" where the kids are murdered in the commune, may have been inspired by that massacre. But none of us were prophetic—none of us knew that the hardhats were going to do what they did on Wall Street. The minute I heard about it, I knew it was going to affect the way the movie was received. I wasn't happy . . . who could be happy about that? If anything, I'm scared. I've been scared for a couple of years. I get scared when I meet people like Joe. And I get scared when I hear that kids are standing up at the end of the movie and yelling. 'I'm going to shoot back, Joe.' In fact, the other night I was walking down 46th Street and I had a flash of myself being shot down in the street, just because someone thought I really was Joe.""Peter pauses for a moment, plucks eight pills in assorted colors of red, white and brown — ""all vitamins,"" he says—from his shirt pocket, and gulps them down with orange juice.""The message of the movie is very plain,"" he goes on. ""It says that we'd just better stop that war in Vietnam now; that we'd just better stop killing our children there or we're going to be killing our children in the streets here. The Bible says that if you live by the sword, you die by the sword, and that's what's going to happen.""Politically speaking, Peter says he is probably best described as a ""conservative radical."" ""I got that from Norman Mailer,"" he says, ""and I like it, although I did not support Mailer for Mayor. I did not want to encourage such excesses of megalomania."" Peter traces his ""leftward leanings"" to Chicago in the summer of 1968, when he was acting at Second City at the time the Democratic convention was going on.""One night I was standing peacefully with some friends in front of a bar in Old Town,"" he recalls, ""and some cops started chasing us. An Episcopal clergyman picked us up in his car, and gave us sanctuary in his house. I remember saying, 'My God, I'm in America, and I'm afraid for my life!' I'm always ready for a fight at any time, but quite frankly, I didn't want my face beaten in just then because I had acting jobs. On another night I was just sitting in my apartment on Schiller Street and I was tear-gassed. At first I thought it was a sneeze coming on, so I took a vitamin C tablet. Then I discovered it was tear gas wafting down from Lincoln Park where the kids were getting gassed.""Despite it all, Peter says he is not entirely unsympathetic with ""Joe."" ""He's a man who's really trapped,"" he says. ""He doesn't like his job, his taxes are sky high, and his kids are causing him trouble at home. Sometimes I worry that maybe we were too hard on him. He is lovable in his own way. But then I get to thinking how scary it is that the hardhats are becoming activists, and it reminds me of the brownshirts in Germany during the thirties. The hardhats say they're patriotic, but their unions are the most notoriously racist of all the unions. If that's who's representing patriotism in our country, then we're really in trouble.""Peter wasn't the first choice for ""Joe."" He read for the part three times and was told he was ""marvelous—but too young,"" so an older, more experienced actor was selected. He didn't work out, and Peter was called in after production had begun to take over the role. He was paid a total of $2,520 for six weeks' work.""At the tryouts, I improvised instead of reading the script they gave me,"" he says, ""because I had been hearing that character all my life. In Philly, where I grew up, people all around me were spouting off about 'those damn niggers, and people on welfare, and wops, and kikes.' I did the same type of character at Second City, and I knew the character so well that when it came to the actual shooting of the movie, I was worried that I would do a caricature.""""Joe"" is not his first movie, but it is the first one he has made a splash in. He was an extra in ""The Group,"" and played the man who ran the gun range in ""Medium Cool."" Peanuts, as far as money goes, but he managed to support himself fairly well doing commercials for TWA (he was the baggage handler), Buick (he was a customer) and Instant Replay (he was a baseball catcher who caught ""the best pitcher in baseball—Tom Seaver""). He has a small part in a group therapy scene in the upcoming ""Diary of a Mad Housewife,"" which he did after ""Joe"" was completed. ""David Gill [""Joe's"" producer] told me I was crazy to do that bit with 'Joe' coming up. I said, 'Look, I don't have any idea what's going to happen to 'Joe.'""Breakfast is over. We walk up Broadway and into Riverside Park, where Peter straddles a park bench. Curly black hair shows beneath his unbuttoned shirt, and he looks so rough, tough and ugly-handsome that he reminds one of Rod Steiger . . . no, Telly Savalas . . . no, the late William Bendix, Or better yet, a mixture of the three, Machismo.It's not surprising, then, that his acting idol is Marlon Brando. ""He's the best,"" Peter declares. ""I had this fantasy of meeting him the other day. Frankly, I'd be a little scared of meeting him. I mean, what would I say?""Peter was born in Philadelphia to Irish immigrant parents. His late father, whose professional name was Pete Boyle, was a commercial artist who later hosted children's shows on a TV station there. Mrs. Boyle now lives in New York with one of Peter's two sisters.Peter became a Christian Brother while a student at La Salle College, but he left the order soon after graduation. ""My name was Brother Francis,"" he recalls, ""and I prayed so hard I had callouses on my knees. I tried to reach God, I did a lot of studying, and I found it was an unnatural way to live. The celibacy is ridiculous. Boy, I really got horny.""I'm really into a Zen thing now,"" he goes on, lying down on his back on the park bench. ""I just don't like the authoritarianism of the Catholic Church. And I don't like the materialism I see in the parishes, with their concern for money and building larger and larger schools. But there are some very exciting people in the church now, like Father Berrigan.""The next stop after the monastery was the U. S. Navy, where Peter was discharged after a few months of service because of a ""severe nervous breakdown."" Then he headed for New York, with dreams of becoming an actor. He took lessons from Uta Hagen, worked in the Post Office and as a bouncer at O'Neals' pub, toured in the national company of ""The Odd Couple,"" and finally hit pay dirt in the television commercial world.Although he has nothing in the works right now, he says he hopes his next job will be another movie. ""You can improvise in the movies. I know, I know, the screenwriters will pull out their hair when they read that. They're all overpaid, anyway. When people first started making movies, the actors improvised. Charlie Chaplin improvised.""Peter improvised some of the dialogue in ""Joe,"" including one line of his lone nude scene where he makes love to a hippie girl. ""I really felt uptight about that scene,"" he says. ""For one thing, I weighed 10 pounds more than I do now. Anyway, I take her breast in my mouth and she says, 'Hey, wait a minute.' Well, I ad-libbed. 'I hope I'm not out of line,' and they left it in.""Does he worry about being typecast as a Silent Majority man?""It's a danger. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. But I think I can do other things. I remember once going up for it part, and the woman said, 'You don't look menacing enough.' This summer I'm in the CBS Comedy Tonight show [Sundays at 9 P.M.], and I took that so I could show people I could do other things, too."" (If you don't recognize him on the show, that's probably because he'll be wearing his hair-piece.)Although Peter has been ""reasonably close to marriage once or twice,"" he is wary because he has seen so many unhappy marriages among his friends. ""I know that if I'd gotten married when I came out of the monastery, I would probably be getting a divorce by now. Being a bachelor has its points. By the time you're 34, you've really been through a lot of things with women, and you know what you don't want. What I want is children. I think a man and woman who live together and have children are very courageous.""It is noon and Peter has an appointment with a photographer, so we walk back to his building. I leave him as I found him, standing on the stoop and guarding the door because he is ashamed of having a stranger see his bare apartment.Judging from the long lines of people queued up to see ""Joe,"" Peter probably won't he ashamed much longer.",Review,By Judy Klemesrud,Archives,,[]

Screen: 'Losers' Arrives:Motorcycle Gangsters at War in Vietnam,1970-08-06,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/06/archives/screen-losers-arrivesmotorcycle-gangsters-at-war-in-vietnam.html,article,"Sooner or later it was bound to happen — a picture about American motorcyclist supermen pitted against the Vietcong on enemy terrain. Brought together overseas by a wary Army command, these five super-tough civilians include two veterans of Vietnam. Their mission is to rescue a Presidential adviser held captive in a remote village.""The Losers,"" opening yesterday on the circuits, has a good idea with some fine, ironic possibilities. And sure enough, this low-budget enterprise uses a slam-bang, blood-dripping massacre of a climax, spearheaded by these hardies, to stress the seeming futility of the war. The film also falls all over itself along the way in dawdling admiration of the bone-crushing quintet as symbols of rebellion.For a full hour — and we timed it — the recruits slam around an outpost town in typical cyclist-movie style, brawling, drinking and anchoring to the local brothel. Watching them cynically, unlike the camera, is a tough-talking Army captain, played by that excellent Negro actor, Bernie Hamilton, who finally gets them — and the show—on the road.Two sideline romances extend right to the front, with the secret-mission truck also carrying two girl friends, and we're not kidding. One of them, as a native girl with a Negro baby from the bordello, is beautifully played by a young Philippine actress named Ana Korita. Her stunned moment of reunion with the captain, who had deserted her, is the only genuinely touching thing in the picture.As for that climactic rescue, the boys roar into the thatched-hut village for an explosive holocaust, with blood flying, quite literally, at the slow-motion camera. The liberated ""Presidential adviser"" turns out to be a cringing, snapping man in a white-linen suit who denounces his burly rescuers as ""trash,"" and leaves two of them to die—all five do. He then barks to the captain: ""Now get me back to Washington so I can straighten out this mess.""On one count, this project shows solid pluck. It was filmed entirely in the Philippines by an independent outfit called Fanfare. The exotic settings, stamped with harshly colored photography, look authentic every inch of the way. There is also evidence that the strapping William Smith, as the brightest of the five, can act. But the scenario by Alan Caillou and the limber direction of Jack Starrett (who also plays the Washingtonian) seem mainly concerned with one thing. War or no war, you can't push these guys around.",Review,By Howard Thompson,Archives,,[]

Screen: Eldridge Cleaver in Algiers,1970-08-25,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/25/archives/screen-eldridge-cleaver-in-algiers.html,article,"""Eldridge Cleaver,"" which opened, without warning, at Cinema II yesterday, is a generally intelligent, wholly sympathetic treatment of the thoughts and personality of Eldridge Cleaver in exile in Algiers. Its apparent aim is not so much to study Cleaver as to provide access to his thoughts and his voice, but in doing this it necessarily does study him. Insofar as Cleaver is the subject, the film is thoughtful, ironic, valuable. Insofar as Johnson, Reagan, Nixon, Agnew and the ""crimes of American imperialism"" are the subjects, the film is very tired and very ordinary propaganda.Directed by William Klein (""Mr. Freedom,"" ""Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee,"" an episode of ""Far From Vietnam""), the film consists at its best of interviews with and scenes from Cleaver's Algerian exile. It includes excellent footage of the First Pan-African Cultural Festival, at which Cleaver spoke, and material from Vietnam, from protest marches and beatings in the United States. It is divided into thought-segments introduced by titles (for example, ""Culture Is a Gun"") flashed on the screen, in the manner of some recent Jean-Luc Godard propaganda movies.However, ""Eldridge Cleaver"" is sufficiently unassertive in its approach to the man to allow his mind and what he has to say essential control—to a degree, even undercutting the more strident rhetoric of some of its images. As he discusses the revolutionary aims and methods of the Panthers, contemplates exile (with rather too desultory a subjective camera exploring the alleys of Algiers), meets African nationalists, laments the captivity in Babylon (the United States) — he emerges as a man of considerable wit, grace, personal sadness and hard-headed realism.Although he advocates an orthodox revolutionary toughness (""So far as I'm concerned, the neutrals are part of the problem.""), he rejects black racism in favor of an internationalism of the oppressed that, if short on analysis, is also short on the appeals to anti-American paranoia that seem so often to motivate ""third-world"" indignation.At one point, Cleaver is shown visiting the North Vietnam delegation in Algiers. Through an interpreter he exchanges friendly views. And before he leaves he poses for Klein's camera, holding hands with the Vietnamese, whom he dwarfs but with whom he seems formally at ease. It is a moment of shy warmth and slightly awkward good feeling, and it is not too atypical of the best film-making in ""Eldridge Cleaver.""",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
