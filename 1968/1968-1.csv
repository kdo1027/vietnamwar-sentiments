TV: War's Impact on North Vietnam:Film Is Presented Over Legislators' Protests Discussion Puts Issue Into Perspective,1968-01-23,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/23/archives/tv-wars-impact-on-north-vietnamfilm-is-presented-over-legislators.html,article,"NOTHWITHSTANDING the protests of 33 members of the House of Representatives, the National Educational Television's presentation of the film on North Vietnam and an accompanying discussion was a useful and thoroughly defsnsible exercise in television journalism.""The N.E.T. Journal,"" seen locally over Channel 13, offered first an abridged version of ""North Vietnam—A Personal Report,"" a film made a year ago by Felix Greene, a British subject, and then a dialogue between Dr. Robert A. Scalapino, professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, and David Schoenbrun, correspondent and lecturer at Columbia University who has visited North Vietnam.Mr. Greene's film, already seen in motion-picture theaters, is a photographically superior work in depicting how the North Vietnamese have rallied against United States air attacks. The use of manual labor to meet the destructive technical power of the United States was well worth the watching, even if Mr. Greene's sympathies for the North Vietnamese could hardly be questioned. The footage showing land laid waste was too extensive and sometimes too moving for one to doubt that the devastation has been substantial.The apprehensions of the Congressman that N.E.T. was peddling enemy propaganda fail to take into account the balanced perspective that immediately followed from the lips of Dr. Scalapino. The professor quickly enumerated crucial points that the film did not cover and argued frankly that the Minister of Information in Hanoi could not have asked for a more pleasing document.But the value of the program which after all was not the first to offer enemy films on TV from North Vietnam sources, came in the subsequent discussion. Mr. Schoenbrun was an able and provocative catalyst for the stimulating considerations of the issues that so severely divide the nation and Dr. Scalapino was brilliantly articulate in the detailed analysis of his viewpoint of the war.For the viewer the advantage was that, using the film as a news peg, ""N.F.T. Journal"" presented one of the better and more lucid discussions of both Mr. Schoenbrun's doubts over the wisdom of American policy in southeast Asia and Dr. Scalapino's specific answers. The division of viewpoint constituted an intellectually provocative and educational dialogue that contained opinions of value to the set owner regardless of his personal feelings.In this respect the program convincingly showed that the freedom of TV is essential to the formation of constructive public opinion, something that protesting Congressmen dishearteningly failed to comprehend. N.E.T. was right and the members of the House wrong. Free discussion is infinitely preferable to the specter of censorship by self-appointed guardians of the public minds.Dick McCutcheon of ""N.E.T. Journal"" was the unobtrusive moderator.Rowan and MartinThe increasing liberality and topicality of Hollywood variety comedy was further evidenced last night in the hour of Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, whose ""Laugh In"" had a preseason tryout and now has deservedly won a niche as a regular series at 8 P. M. Mondays over the National Broadcasting Company's network. Rowan and Martin are N. B. C.'s answer to the Smothers Brothers of the Columbia Broadcasting System.Mr. Rowan and Mr. Martin might be likened to the overseers of a swinging 1968 version of ""Hellzapoppin.'"" Their hour is an extraordinarily quick succession of sight laughs and sketches, many with a deft and good-natured satirical edge to give the show a contemporary pertinency.Unlike the heavy-handed ""That Was the Week That Was"" but like the tone of the Smothers Brothers, Rowan and Martin are showmen enough to realize that they can needle most of the passing scene if only they do not forget their role as humorists.In the course of the program there were references that undoubtedly would have stung Gov. Ronald Reagan of California. The day was envisioned when Howard Hughes would buy the Grand Canyon to hang new portraits. There was a tongue-in-cheek ode to the Establishment and mention of a modern spiritual leader, Bobby Baker. The popularity of marijuana and sexual freedom among the youth were introduced in one guise or another. The program hinted at a bombing de-escalation when the Vietcong reached the suburbs of Paris.Individually, the quips would not seem too unusual outside the context of television, but on the home screen they certainly, represented a significant departure from video's traditional devotion to timeless banality in variety.Rowan and Martin, who boast a good supporting company of fellow stage conspirators, and the Smothers Brothers could represent the deepest TV change of the current season. The sacred cows of today's society no longer are immune to the irreverence of the newer school of comedians, and it will be important to see how far their influence and ingenuity may spread.In a recent syndicated radio program, Alan King, the comedian, suggested that one reason some viewers might be turning away from TV was its isolation from the realities of the surrounding world. The restless humorists ironically may be the instrument for gradually and subtly bringing TV into the mainstream of modern concern. And the Establishment may possibly have more to fear in the long run from the contagion of laughter than from the more publicized stern protest.",Review,By Jack Gould,Archives,,['Inside North Vietnam (Movie)']

Sebastian' Arrives,1968-01-25,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/25/archives/sebastian-arrives.html,article,"""SEBASTIAN,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Theater and other houses, is what might be called a medium saturation put-on. A high saturation put-on would be a film like ""Modesty Blaise,"" in which plot, dialogue and décor feature an invention a minute in the hope that something will work. A really low saturation put-on would be any of the films of Andy Warhol, in which the invention is at absolute zero, and the complete put-on is that there is really nothing there to be put-on by.Sebastian (played by Dirk Bogarde) is an Oxford mathematician and master decoder for British Intelligence. He has a large staff of young women working for him at rows of desks, which he can see through the picture window of his office one flight up. He is in the habit of chanting with his female staff, responsively:""And when we finish?""""Everybody goes home!""""And when do we finish?""""Never!""This is chanted with enormous hilarity, as though everyone was having such good fun. And one of the problems with this sort of movie is the enormous pressure that it puts on the audience to have a good time over almost nothing. The music, in particular, becomes hysterically jaunty at moments when absolutely nothing is going on on the screen. (""Modesty Blaise,"" in which some hysterically jaunty action was going on all the time, was even less relaxed, and therefore worse.)Sebastian has a middle-aged leftist assistant (Lili Palmer) who objects to the Vietnam war, and a dipsoaniacal Saturday mistress (Janet Munro), who, in the service of a foreign power, freaks him out on LSD. These are the two with-it contemporary touches.For the rest, he is pursued to his bedroom by Susannah York. She ultimately has a baby by him—a very interesting looking, not at all soap-commercial baby, whose rattle helps him break a Russian satellite blip code. He also has some scenes with Sir John Gielgud, as Head of Intelligence.The put-on, of course, consists in never really letting the audience know what level of seriousness the film is at, and the movie itself sometimes seems unsure. Apropos of Vietnam: ""In these days, all sane loyalties are divided."" Apropos of nothing in particular: ""Ha, bloody, Ha."" Apropos of Bogarde's slapping Miss York in a bedroom scene: ""You are in a bad way, aren't you."" This last is really rather poignant in context, and the film stops for a moment at sad-modern serious.Miss York gets slapped once, Miss Munro twice. (The put-on as a form is almost always extremely hostile to women.) Miss York does quite well as the sort of against-his-will, healthy seductress she is meant to play; but some scenes in which she has to fight Bogarde physically (and he has lines like ""Don't rupture yourself"") would be impossible for anyone. Bogarde plays his usual dry, reserved, slightly sinister part, which is so ill-suited to comedy. Gielgud's part is really a walk-on.It is unfortunate to be hard on this sort of British product, which is so much better, funnier, and more articulate than its American equivalent (the latest bumbling Dean Martin extravaganza, ""How to Save A Marriage—and Ruin Your Life,"" comes to mind). The decoding idea, for instance, is a good one, although absolutely nothing is made of it; and some of the lines are lovely. Of Sebastian's LSD experience, Gielgud says, ""Well, we all need taking out of ourselves from tune to time.""The opening scene, in which Bogarde is racing around Oxford in his academic robes until he meets Miss York and asks her to spell her name backward, has a fine White Rabbit/Alice in Wonderland quality, which is immediately abandoned, too. If only people wouldn't try to spoof everything at once, but concentrate on doing a thought-out funny thing or two.",Review,RENATA ADLER,Archives,,[]
