The American Way in Asia as seen by Robert Osborn,1971-03-01,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/01/archives/state-of-our-asia-policy.html,article,"In his State of the World Message, President Nixon sought to demonstrate a non‐hostile disposition toward China. There were amiable references to “a dialogne with Peking,” and the possi bility of China's playing “a construc tive role in the family of nations.” But Washington would continue to oppose, the seating of Peking's dele gation in the U.N. at the expense of Taipei's representation, and we stand by our 1954 treaty with “the Republic of China on Taiwan.” In sum, no change.",Archives,By O.

Sporting Club' Opens,1971-03-01,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/01/archives/sporting-club-opens.html,article,"Never, never have the good old days of Hollywood seemed so golden, at least lately, as with the unreeling of a new something-or-other titled ""The Sporting Club"" at the Coronet. What is this thing about?Apparently, a rustic hunting lodge in Michigan, where a group of guzzling high-livers from the city are holding a reunion, is supposed to signify structural America. Toward the end, the building is dynamited (after repeated hints that the Vietnam War is undermining things). The club members, men and women, stagger around in the ruins to a thunderous soundtrack rendition of ""Battle Hymn of the Republic.""Earlier, 20 minutes or so, there was a smaller-scale dynamiting of a new dam, at which a rally of war veterans and American Gothic types is being held. Hoping, praying that was the end, I reached for my shoes. No such luck.But the picture finally does end, after more hints, in a wallow of sex and violence (the facade of America?). As the color camera whips around in a frenzy of half-shadows, the braying club members strip down for a mass orgy. And we guarantee you've never seen such a repulsive array of flabby, middle-aged blubber.Studiously plunked down and magnified in a naturalistic, woodsy setting, the stilted, elliptical dialogue, the heavy stylization of the performances and the insistently pointed direction of Larry Peerce (of ""Goodbye, Columbus,"" believe it or not), render it a plodding artificial bore.Lorenzo Semple Jr. has adapted the source, a novel by Thomas McGuane, which a reviewer for this newspaper said ""almost put him to sleep.""

The United. States has broken with the tradition by convicting in midwar one of its own men, First Lieut. William L. Caney Jr., of murder‐. ing Vietnamese civilians, and thus has confronted its footsoldiers and its commanders with a series of legal conflicts. As so often happens, the pinch appears tobe primarily upon the foot soldiers. Lieutenant Calley's conviction demonstrated, if there was any doubt, that the excuse that “I was just following orders” will not work. He contended that he had been ordered to “waste” the villagers at Mylai, but the Uniform Code of Military. Justice says that this is no defense if “a man of ordinary sense and understanding would know [the order] to be illegal.”",Archives,By Fred P.
