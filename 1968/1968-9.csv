'17th Parallel: Vietnam in War' and Schoenbrun 'Dialogue',1968-09-27,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/09/27/archives/17th-parallel-vietnam-in-war-and-schoenbrun-dialogue.html,article,"A CONVINCING and disturbing case against American intervention in Vietnam is being made by a documentary feature at the Bleecker Street Cinema titled ""17th Parallel: Vietnam and War."" Fortifying this tonic effect is a half-hour supplement called ""Vietnam Dialogue,"" in which the seasoned David Schoenbrun simply states his own views on the matter, and most forcefully so.The eloquence and power of the feature lies in its on-the-spot crudeness and unquestionable authenticity. Joris Ivens, a highly respected Dutch documentary-maker, has captured a close-quarter camera record of the war as weathered by determined peasants and their families, united with tough guerrillas and all under North Vietnamese Army leadership.The camera glues to these people, whether in action or taking a break during interviews by the photographer and others behind the camera. Their replies, and some effective soliloquies, spoken both in Vietnamese and French (by the Army officers) are given sparse but succinct English titles.It is a small wonder, considering the emphatic anti-Americanism of tone and content, that Mr. Ivens and his assistant, Marceline Loridan, were abetted by the Hanoi Documentary Studio. Nearly every utterance, by young and old, denounces the American ""bandits"" methodically and fiercely.We see armed farmers tending rice paddies fully armed and stoically squatting (a camouflage strategy) as planes roar overhead, a sound that punctuates most of the picture. There is the incredibly determined hand-to-mouth organization of the peasants, cheerfully burrowing into underground shelters with makeshift schools and even hospitals. The most blood-curdling part of the film, replete with horrifying shots to the dead and wounded, shows some underground children, mere toddlers, being taught how to handle captured Americans. ""Hands up, not hand up,"" corrects the teacher.It looks and sounds real and frightening, with plenty of food for thought.",Review,HOWARD THOMPSON,Archives,,['17th Parallel: Vietnam in War (Movie)']
