' I. F. Stone's Weekly' Is a Film Delight,1973-10-19,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/19/archives/i-f-stones-weekly-is-a-film-delight.html,article,"It's only 62 minutes long. It was photographed in black and white with a religious austerity. It has no theme music. It is a documentary, and its title sounds like something glimpsed on an index card at the Public Library.Yet Jerry Bruck Jr.'s ""I. F. Stone's Weekly,"" which opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room, is such a thorough delight it left me feeling the way other people said they felt after seeing ""The Sound of Music."" That is, quite high.I should admit that ""The Sound of Music"" depressed me. It evoked civilization's imminent collapse. It made me think of the Chinese Communists and suspect that they'd be taking us over sooner rather than later. What was the use of thought or reason? Our minds have already turned into mashed potatoes.Or have they?Not, I think, as long as Isadore Feinstein Stone is on the American scene, passionately exposing the fallacies, double-talk and ignorance of the various rascals in Government, elected, appointed or there simply because of being someone's friend.I. F. Stone, now 66, has been a maverick all his life, a Communist anarchist in his youth, once described as ""a strident voice of illiberalism"" by Spiro T. Agnew, and now self-defined as a counter-revolutionary.Through it all, he has been the ferocious conscience of American journalists and those American citizens who would listen to him in person or who subscribed to his newsletter, which he started in 1952 and finally folded in 1971, when he moved his often dumfounded prose to the New York Review of Books.""I. F. Stone's Weekly"" is no dopey paean to a great man. Supplemented by a modest, informative commentary spoken by Tom Wicker, the film presents Izzy Stone straight, with all his eccentricities and enthusiasms intact, in interviews, in public speeches and even walking down to the corner to stuff a week's issue into the post box.We listen to Izzy describe a hilarious early confrontation with the Atomic Energy Commission (about underground testing), requiring him to make a visit to some seismology experts in the Commerce Department's Coast and Geodetic Survey. ""They were so glad to see a reporter. I don't think they'd seen a reporter since there was a tremble from Mount Ararat, when Noah's Ark landed.""He describes the danger for Washington correspondents who become pals with statesmen (""You begin to understand there are certain things the public ought not to know""). He talks about his own lean years as a blacklisted reporter and the genesis of his weekly, through which he taught all the rest of us how to find stories within stories, through inconsistencies, through information inadvertently made public but unnoticed by other reporters.The film brilliantly succeeds in communicating Stone's near-obsessive interest in truth and his optimism. The war in Vietnam, he suggests, and the survival of the Vietnamese people through years of bombing have re-established ""the primacy of man in an age of technology.""Toward the end Stone tells a group of students: ""I really have so much fun I ought to be arrested."" There is more to that statement than sentimental fondness for his profession. A cub reporter, he says, may get so excited covering a big fire that he forgets that something really it burning.As Jerry Bruck Jr. is lucky to have a subject as dynamic as Stone, so is Stone lucky to have a young film maker as persistent and as obsessed, in his way, as Bruck. ""I.F. Stone's Weekly"" has been three years in the making, on a shoestring, and in bits and pieces. The result is a rare film, a fitting tribute to a man who never gives up.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
