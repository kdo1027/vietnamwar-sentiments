It previously was presented on television in France. The hour-long movie, produced by Pierre Schoendorffer and filmed by Domínique Merlin, follows the activities of an American platoon under the command of Lieut. Joseph Anderson, in the central highlands of Vietnam in 1966.Jack Gould, reviewing the TV documentary for The New York Times, called it ""a many-sided experience that was related with compelling human understanding."" He said that it was ""not only a lean and stark account of individuals in battle but a composite glimpse of the American character responding to the ultimate stress.""""The Anderson Platoon,"" Mr. Gould continued, ""reflected the outlook of a compassionate reporter who went to the front lines with his camera and often in astonishing close-ups caught the full, horrible drama of war for the men who do the fighting.""",Review,,Archives,,[]

Screen: 'Live for Life' at the Fine Arts:Candice Bergen Appears With Yves Montand Camera Work Upstages Picture's Narrative,1967-12-19,https://www.nytimes.com/1967/12/19/archives/screen-live-for-life-at-the-fine-artscandice-bergen-appears-with.html,article,"CLAUDE LELOUCH loves the camera. He loves motion photography. He loves the myriad melanges of images he can splash and flow upon the screen. He also loves agitating combinations of offscreen sounds and melodies that form patterns of sensuous stimulation along with pictorial images.Indeed, I do suspect Mr. Lelouch, the young French director who made the elaborately pictorial and romantic ""A Man and a Woman,"" which ran at the Paris for more than a year, prefers these things — photography and movement, sounds and musical effects—to the dramatic ideas or statements to be fashioned out of them.I certainly got that impression from ""A Man and a Woman,"" which displayed a great deal of bold cinematic virtuosity to put across a diverting but trivial tale. And now I more strongly suspect it after seeing his latest French film, ""Live for Life"" (""Vivre Pour Vivre""), which came to the Fine Arts yesterday.In this casual cross-ruffing of the marital and extramarital affairs of a French television director who goes with his cameramen in search of pictures all over the world, Mr. Lelouch takes his camera to Africa, Amsterdam, New York, Vietnam and all over Paris, making pictures, pictures, pictures wherever he is.When his man leaves his wife in Paris and goes to Africa with a girl he has first spoken to, in passing, at a motel and has later picked up at a Paris restaurant, Mr. Lelouch gives us maybe 20 minutes of flashy footage of a big game hunt in Kenya and maybe as much of a TV interview with Belgian, French and German mercenaries in the Congo.With his man back home and then off with his wife for an anniversary revisit in Amsterdam, Mr. Lelouch follows the two around that city for a virtual travelogue, mixing a lot of two-timing scurrying hither and yon by the fellow when his girl arrives and puts up in the same hotel.Later he gives us lots of nice shots of the disappointed girl roaming sadly around New York, and a long sequence of the fellow shooting footage of grisly war and atrocity sights in Vietnam. And he concludes his film with some handsome but repetitious pictures of a Swiss ski resort, where the fellow is reunited with his wife.It all looks great in color, and Mr. Lelouch bedazzles the eye with startling close-ups, helicopter panoramas, wobbly camera shots and out-of-focus smears. He throws in strong sound effects and music, especially one reiterant melody that bears a marked resemblance to the popular ""A Man and a Woman"" theme.But the point of it all is elusive, and the characters are as random and dull — really dull, when you come right down to it—as were the characters in Mr. Lelouch's previous film. Yves Montand as the fellow is tedious with his endless deceptions and bland conceit, and Annie Giradot is tiresome and annoying as his smirking, complacent wife. Candice Bergen is beautiful but banal as the passing mistress who lets herself be walked upon. All they prove is that preoccupation with self is vexatious to others in this crowded world.It is notable and significant that Mr. Lelouch never lets us know the purpose or point of view of his TV director. He just makes pictures. So does Mr. Lelouch. And, like so many who fall in love with their own work, he doesn't know when to stop.",Review,By Bosley Crowther,Archives,,[]

Screen: Flower Children's Manifesto:'Hippie Revolt' Begins With a Whimper,1967-12-20,https://www.nytimes.com/1967/12/20/archives/screen-flower-childrens-manifestohippie-revolt-begins-with-a.html,article,"IF the searching young souls depicted in ""The Hippie Revolt,"" ever expect to get through to the old folks at home, including this one, they had best stop peppering their testimonies with the nagging, hackneyed bit, ""Ya know?"" No, we don't know whatcha mean. So there. Ya know?This color, feature documentary, put together by some people on the West Coast who scoured various assemblies and lairs of the flower children, beardies, weirdies and truly dedicated whatsies, does have two distinct merits. As a darting camera tour of a swelling army of nonconformists, the film will smite older eyes for projecting a strange breed of birds of mismatching but incredibly colored plumage. Also, the picture wisely does let the kids do most of the talking, and some of the lengthier personal testimonies are interesting.Some are funny, some touching and some jolting. In one sequence, showing several hippie ""weddings,"" performed amid a spirited mob in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury section, the ""minister"" asks the bridegroom the wilt-thou question. ""You know it, man,"" he answers. Another hippie bridegroom replies, ""Yeh.""The most impressive bit is a thoughtful soliloquy by a teen-age mother, clutching at her small boy and flanked by other relaxed hippies in a sylvan retreat called Strawberry Fields. All of them, excluding the child, are casually sharing an unfiltered cigarette.Some of the other discourses are almost as effective, such as when the camera picks out some scowling peace-parade marchers, all of whom advocate universal love and the end of the killing in Vietnam. However, what might have given the movie its candid power and point is blunted, since this sequence is theatrically rigged by the director and the footage editor.The phoniest rigging of all is the breathless, garish framework for some testimonies on narcotics with most of the unseen users stressing escapism rather than habit, as the camera swirls in abstract colors and electronic strings twang away. And finally, not one person from the other side of the spiritual moat, young or old, gets to open his mouth, although a clean-cut young Navy recruit bound for Vietnam almost makes it after a scalding put-down by a stringy-haired hippie.The general tone and content of this film are pinpointed by one scribbled hippie slogan fleetingly caught by the camera: ""Like father, like son, like hell.""",Review,,Archives,,[]
