His reference to the Saigon airport as “Cain Hut Thuoc” was surprising, since news dispatches when the airport has been under Vietcong fire have referred to it as Tansonnhut. Remembering a few words of Vietnamese, however, I realized that Mr. Kahn had miscopied the words from a sign which said “Cam Hut Thuoc,” which means No Smoking! In this respect he has joined another unwitting punster, Robert S.

Screen: 'The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus',1971-05-31,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/31/archives/screen-the-great-chicago-conspiracy-circus.html,article,"If you recall last year's Off Broadway ""Chicago 70,"" which was put on by the Toronto Workshop Company at the Martinique Theater here, you're hereby apprised that the 16mm. color film version on view at the Film Forum through next weekend is essentially the same improvisational dramatization. It includes excerpts of the 1969-70 trial of the ""Chicago 8"" with infusions of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" juvenile classroom recitations and pseudo-radio broadcasts. The film version, labeled ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus,"" is decidedly true to its title as ""circus,"" ""conspiracy"" and justifiable polemics, but it is rarely moving as movie drama.Basically, a moviegoer is affected by what he sees and even if the truth, like the politics of our time, is both tragic and comic, it has to be strongly visualized as well as declared on screen. There is a great speaking of minds from the actual record in ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus"" but, unfortunately, there is not a great deal to stir the hearts or the eyes of the uninitiate.As noted, the polemics as well as the confusion of a baffled Judge Julius J. Hoffman facing the taunts and life-style (and the psychedelic dress) of the disparate likes of Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, Allen Ginsberg (reciting some of his explicitly sexual poems) and Country Joe McDonald singing his anti-Vietnam rock, are forceful and to the point.One is also Impressed that maintaining law and order before defendants and attorneys who are trying to stress that the court is not their idea of law and order any more than is Mayor Richard J. Daly's rule of Chicago strikes effective notes for both the Establishment and a younger generation divorced from it.Kerry Feltham, the director, who has employed practically the same cast that George Luscombe used in the play, has drawn forthright declamations from all of them, both black and white. And, it must be noted that, while it is sometimes confusing, different actors are sometimes switched to play the same role, such as Judge Hoffman's, and do prove their versatility.The cast, to name a few such as Mel Dixon, Jim Lawrence, Peter Faulkner, Neil Walsh and Diane Grant and not to slight the others, are Yippie, hippie and serious enough to project authentic dedication to their art and dialogue. But like the documentary ""Breathing Together: Revolution of the Electric Family,"" seen here last month and also dealing with the trial, ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus,"" which was photographed on sets with a mirror background, is generally as static as a photographed play.What the Toronto Workshop Company has to say is obviously ingenious theater even if it is political and perhaps partisan. But it is, sadly enough, good rhetoric that does not add up to an exciting or innovative film.",Review,By A. H. Weiler,Archives,,[]

More than 50 companies are drilling, doing geological studies or hold ing concessions. This activity has drawn the attention of some antiwar groups that have charged that the United States is fight ing in South Vietnam to protect oil industry interests. Thus far, most Congressmen appear to consider the charges unsubstantiated. The Saigon Government, however, is interested in attracting the oil industry to the area. On industry's side, preliminary seismic studies of offshore Vietnam have labeled it as geo logically “a good risk.” Only two countries in the entire area are producing oil in substan tial commercial quantities—Australia and In donesia. Indonesia, the center of most of the activity, is now producing about 900,000 bar‐ rels a day, almost entirely from onshore wells, but output is expected to climb to more than a million barrels a day this year, with the bulk of the addition coming from offshore wells. In the waters off Burma, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia, the activity is confined to surveys or preliminary drilling. Every Asian nation would like to find oil at home or at least nearby, and this quest has brought Japan, South Korea and Taiwan into con flict over jurisdiction and rights to grant con cessions in certain sections of the East China Sea. Communist China also is interested in oil in the area. United States awareness of this was demonstrated last week when it warned the Gulf Oil Corporation, which has an exploration contract with the Chinese Na tionalists, that it could not protect survey or drilling ships in the disputed areas around the Senkaku Islands.",Archives,,Archives,,[]

Our directness and rapidity of reaction, in bombing North Vietnamese installations and deploying U.S. combat forces to Southeast Asia were others. Each step played a part. Their effect was to in terrupt the continually improving Com munist posture, catch the imagination of the Southeast Asian peoples, provide some lift to morale, however temporary, and force CHICOM/DRV assessment or reassessment of U.S. intentions. But these were only steps along the way. What we have not done and must do is make plain to Hanoi and Peiping the cost of pursuing their current objectives and impeding ours. An essential element of our military action in this course is to proceed in the development of our physical readiness posture: deploying troops, ships, aircraft, and logistic re sources in a manner which accords a maximum freedom of action. This is the thrust we should continue to pursue, one which is intended to provide more than one feasible course for considera tion as the changed and changing South east Asian situation develops. Remarks in the paragraphs which follow are sub mitted in light of this assessment and with the view that pressures against the other side once instituted should not be relaxed by any actions or lack of them which would destroy the bene fits of the rewarding steps previously taken in Laos and North Vietnam.",Archives,,Archives,,['Vietnam']

Analysis of the present situation. The situation in South Vietnam is de teriorating. Even before the government sank into confusion last week, the course of the war in South Vietnam had been downward, with Viet Cong incidents in creasing in number and intensity and military actions becoming larger and more successful, and with less and less territory meaningfully under the control of the government. Successful ambushes had demonstrated an unwillingness of the population even in what were thought to be pacified areas to run the risk of informing on the Viet Cong. War weariness was apparent. The crisis of the end of August—especially since the competing forces have left the govern ment largely “faceless” and have dam aged the government's ability to manage the pacification program—promises to lead to further and more rapid deteriora tion. The objective of the United States is to reverse the present down ward trend. Failing that, the alternative objective is to emerge from the situa tion with as good an image as possible in US, allied and enemy eyes.",Archives,,Archives,,['Vietnam']

"Screen: Nicholson's 'Drive, He Said':Movie Marks Actor's Debut as Director Tale of College Athlete Opens at Tower East",1971-06-14,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/14/archives/screen-nicholsons-drive-he-saidmovie-marks-actors-debut-as-director.html,article,"""Drive, He Said,"" loosely adapted by Jeremy Larner and Jack Nicholson from Larner's 1964 Delta Prize novel, and directed by Nicholson (his directorial debut), comes close to being the sort of movie about the anxieties and dilemmas of the sixties that no one ever made in the sixties—which were constantly confused with the more innocent fifties. It is not a great film, but it is an often intelligent one, and it is so much better than all of the rest of the campus junk Hollywood has manufactured in the last couple of years that it can be indulged its sentimental conventions.Specifically, it's about a star college athlete, Hector Bloom, to whom basketball is what boxing is to Private Prewitt what playwriting maybe to Tennessee Williams and what risking an arm or a leg or a life probably is to Peter Gimbel. Like some forms of art, it is, simultaneously, a heightened response to the world, a mystical retreat from it, and a practical way of getting along in it.In the course of his senior year, Hector begins to feel, in his word, disconnected. The old game doesn't quite mean what it once did. He is more than a little surprised to find that he is in love with Olive, the professor's wife with whom he's been having an affair, and he is shocked when the joy of his discovery isn't shared by Olive, who is not so simply pregnant.Hector admires and envies the campus radicals, who are so committed to a cause that they can interrupt a basketball game for an anti-Vietnam demonstration, staged as guerrilla theater. He himself hasn't the faintest idea where he is going or why. When a pro ball club asks him to sign, he demands only that the club improve the quality of the frankfurters it sells to the public, and cut the price from 50c to a quarter.In fact, Hector is so disconnected—at least in terms of the character as written—that it comes as a major surprise, late in the film, to learn that he is a Greek major. This bit of information, which I assume is presented seriously, is as unsettling as learning that someone you thought you knew extremely well is, in reality, one-half of a pair of twins. It means that an important (or, at the least, a time-consuming) part of Hector's life has been kept secret.Also fairly secret is Hector's state of mind, though William Tepper, a tall, dark-haired young man who may or may not have studied the collected works of Dustin Hoffman, defines well enough Hector's individual attitudes of frustration, anger and what might be called romantic campus lassitude. A reading of Larner's novel fills in a lot of these gaps, but otherwise the novel might mislead the filmgoer into expecting satiric fantasy (which the movie never achieves), having to do with unnamed wars (not in Vietnam), with a lot of bizarre characters who might have been created by Waugh, and with middle-class American-Jewish intellectual and social life.One result of this secrecy—perhaps simplification is a better terms—is that most of the other characters in the film, just because they are the supporting characters in the film as well as in Hector's life, are more thoroughly and quickly defined, and thus more vivid and appealing than Hector. I especially liked Karen Black as the besieged Olive, a woman who once might have ben fated to be misunderstood and badly used by men, but who finally liberates herself; Robert Towne, as her husband, who would prefer to dry his beard with an electric comb than wory about cuckoldry; Bruce Dern, as the intensely clean-living coach, and Michael Margotta, who looks like a young Elisha Cook Jr., as Hector's radical roommate whose ultimate act of survival provides the film with its obligatory, if shopworn, irony.Most importantly, al of the film's characters, and all of the performances, are touched with the kind of unexpected sensibility and decency that are rare in most films of this genre. It's a quality that I associate with the performances Nicholson himself gave in both ""Easy Rider"" and ""Five Easy Pieces."" Nicholson not only is good with actors, but he also chooses to avoid most of the visual (and aural) clichés of the day, and when he does indulge himself—as in the fine basketballl sequences—they no longer seem clichés since the rhythm of the sport more or less demands the treatment. I wish I could report that Hector was as interesting as the film that surrounds him.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

Newley's 'Summertree' Opens:Hume and Yafa Work Revisits the 40's Death of a Serviceman Fixes the Action,1971-06-17,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/17/archives/newleys-summertree-openshume-and-yafa-work-revisits-the-40s-death.html,article,"Anybody old enough can remember, and anybody not old enough may imagine, the mood of sentiment about the land and the ordinary people and the quality of tree-shaded life in middle-America that gripped the popular arts, and especially the movies, during and for a few years after World War II. The mood passes—for a good many reasons—by the early 1950's, but a certain nostalgia for it remains. That nostalgia has been felt in several movies recently—movies that mean to recreate the 1940's—and it now appears brought up to date in Anthony Newley's ""Summertree,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters and which attempts indicting the barbarities of Vietnam in terms of decent emotional strategies developed to illustrate life on the home front 30 years ago.I never saw the successful Ron Cowen play upon which ""Summertree"" is based, but I gather there have been a lot of changes—mostly directed toward ""relevance"" and a slight juicing up of the action. There is a new character, a little black boy (Kirk Callaway), who speaks for separatism. And the girl friend (Brenda Vaccaro) is now a somewhat older woman who already has a husband—in Vietnam. But the boy (Michael Douglas) with each toss of his rugged head, each glance from his friendly eyes, bespeaks Young America. And the gruff dad (Jack Warden) who nervously loves his son and finally betrays him into war, and mom who cares and puts on the coffee — they are an older America that appropriately lives for the young. Barbara Bel Geddes plays mom, and one closed-mouth smile of hers is surely worth 350 apple pies cooling in the kitchen window.The central image of the summertree itself — a backyard retreat where the boy goes to dream his life into being—survives in rather ridiculous ways: especially in a bit of tinkly music, and a worm-eaten leaf pattern superimposed on the screen over his first night of lovemaking with the girl friend. And his death, which is in fact the reason for the drama, is there also, as a final bitter irony of the war that the movie, not too stupidly, admits wholly through the medium of the television screen.""Summertree"" is a bad movie, but its badness proceeds not from its intentions, which seem honorable, or from its stylistic analogies to past modes, which in different hands could have been interesting. The badness exists, rather, moment by moment, in the insufficiency of each acted scene, in the niggling insecurity of Newley's camera, in the improverishment of each evocation of a quality of life—from the boy's dull guitar playing, which is supposed to be great, to the father's love of hunting, which should recreate the landscape, but only signifies a thoughtless and cruel pastime.Nobody's performance quite works in ""Summertree,"" but it is possible at least to respect Jack Warden's tense privacies and Michael Douglas's restraint in projecting a youthful goodwill without either petulance or excessive charm. Brenda Vaccaro is reasonable off-type casting, but she does not seem resourceful enough even to explore the limits of this small, appealingly pathetic role.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

Some others, never the greatest, are merely obscure. It is in this second category, films that by their own confusions and inadequacies fail to make the kind of sense they so unclearly intend, that Edwin Sherin's ""Glory Boy,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Forum theaters, belongs.""Glory Boy"" is yet another movie made not about, but under the shadow of, the Vietnam War. When its young hero (Michael Moriarty) returns home to his father's run-down farm north of San Francisco, he brings with him a stupid but relatively harmless Army buddy (William Devane) and a Regular Army sergeant (Mitchell Ryan) who is more or less waiting put his 30 days before re-enlisting.The sergeant is no friend, merely somebody picked up because his stern jaw, his medals and his military manner will please the old man. But behind his tough exterior seethes a soul of sulfuric acid, and after he has humiliated dad, knocked unconscious a hitchhiking college girl (Topo Swope) so as to rape her, and dynamited the fish in the trout stream, it becomes fairly obvious that he is a one-man social, moral and ecological disaster.Between the father (Arthur Kennedy) and the sergeant there is a certain equivalence, for the old man has in gentler ways ruined everything he has touched (so you shouldn't miss the point, he keeps praising the farm as a Garden of Eden) and he too represents the militarism of an age—the age of World War II. The film recognizes that the two wars are not equal—the father is fallen from sentimental ideals; the sergeant is pure evil force—but symbolically and, at last, literally, the two cancel each other out.I think this is the most significant action in ""Glory Boy,"" though there are several others, and there is a whole household full of representative types—including the girl who, unaccountably, comes back to cook and clean and put flowers on the dining room table. But except for what fits together all too neatly, nothing seems to belong with anything else, and it all feels like watching a series of strung-together three-minute sketches. Sherin's direction stresses action in the middle distance not all that bad, but limiting and the multiplication of pregnant pauses — so that sometimes it looks as though the actors really are standing around wondering what to do next.Almost everybody figures out something reasonable in time—except for William Devane, who plays for a kind of instant insanity and ends up suggesting, say, Jerry Lewis as Macbeth. But the two principle kids, Michael Moriarty and Topo Swope, really are something special—appealing without courting appeal, sympathetic without the production of any unnecessary charm. Michael Moriarty particularly brings a rather intricate intelligence to an almost incomprehensible role. But both he and Miss Swope introduce a quality I should never have expected in this movie—a quality of articulate and active lucidity.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

What is this thing about?Apparently, a rustic hunting lodge in Michigan, where a group of guzzling high-livers from the city are holding a reunion, is supposed to signify structural America. Toward the end, the building is dynamited (after repeated hints that the Vietnam War is undermining things). The club members, men and women, stagger around in the ruins to a thunderous soundtrack rendition of ""Battle Hymn of the Republic.""Earlier, 20 minutes or so, there was a smaller-scale dynamiting of a new dam, at which a rally of war veterans and American Gothic types is being held. Hoping, praying that was the end, I reached for my shoes. No such luck.But the picture finally does end, after more hints, in a wallow of sex and violence (the facade of America?). As the color camera whips around in a frenzy of half-shadows, the braying club members strip down for a mass orgy. And we guarantee you've never seen such a repulsive array of flabby, middle-aged blubber.Studiously plunked down and magnified in a naturalistic, woodsy setting, the stilted, elliptical dialogue, the heavy stylization of the performances and the insistently pointed direction of Larry Peerce (of ""Goodbye, Columbus,"" believe it or not), render it a plodding artificial bore.Lorenzo Semple Jr. has adapted the source, a novel by Thomas McGuane, which a reviewer for this newspaper said ""almost put him to sleep.""

The Screen:Documentary on Cuba Is at New Yorker,1971-11-19,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/19/archives/the-screendocumentary-on-cuba-is-at-new-yorker.html,article,"Felix Greene, the British cameraman-journalist-author, who gave us feature-length color close-ups of ""China!"" in 1965 and ""North Vietnam"" two years later, continues his role as a movie Marco Polo for the embattled Left in ""Cuba Va!"", his latest color documentary on a nation largely concealed by a ""curtain."" As in the previous cases, he illustrates a contented people, who admittedly haven't yet achieved their revolutionary goals but are, as the title translates, moving forward.Using some old black-and-white footage to stress the enrichment of the few wealthy, both local and foreign, and the deprivation of the masses of the poor and ignorant Latin Americans, Greene, who shot his color film over the last year or so, makes visual comparisons in generally calm and effective style.With Premier Fidel Castro appearing on a few occasions to explain that Cuban freedom could be achieved only by revolution after 400 years of foreign domination, the film's natural bias is apparent but not overpowering. It opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema.The ""85 per cent"" illiteracy that existed 12 years ago when Castro ousted the former dictator, Fulgencio Batista, is given cheerful counterpoint by happy youngsters and adults receiving free education and instruction in trades in various immaculate up-to-date urban and rural schools. The admitted fact that did not meet its 10-million-ton sugar cane goal last year is offset by various scenes showing the harvesting of eight and a half million tons, a record crop.A viewer is fascinated by workers from other areas chipping to voluntarily to help with the cane, tobacco and other harvests; by a fine teachers college, medical school with many distaff students, and an especially modern psychiatric hospital near Havana; by an orchestra devoted to Western classics that is viewed, somewhat less favorably, than an excellent modern dance team working with native rhythms as another sign of Cuba's socialistic approach to the arts.One is impressed by younger composer-guitarists such as Silvio Rodriguez, Noel Nicola and Pablo Milanes, whose fine voices extol their brave new world. And one assumes that Mr. Greene knows what he is talking about in noting that ""the cinemas are filled and a nightclub has to be booked weeks in advance.""One also get glimpses of modern highways being built and slums being razed and a climactic scene showing Cubans reacting forcefully in Havana demonstrations when their captive fishermen were freed by Americans last year. The over-all impression sought by Mr. Greene is a bright present and a brighter future. But despite his largely happy vistas, his ""Cuba Va!"" leaves a nagging feeling that it is only a partial view of current history that still desperately needs fuller explanations.Also on the bill is ""Reggae,"" a 60-minute documentary on Jamaican music filmed at a concert in London last year and intercut with observations on its origins and purposes. As an outgrowth of traditional African, calypso, rock, soul and blues, its beat is infectious.And, even though Mike Raven, a British disk jockey, explains that ""Reggae"" was the name of the first record label to feature that genre and that it is also a form of protest, it is basically an item for the buffs, who should appreciate it most.",Review,By Howard Thompson,Archives,,[]

See this engrossing film, which has a cast headed by Mike Simms and Burl Bullock, excellent color photography by Mike Rhodes and keen direction by Wendell James Franklin.

But good deeds and intentions aside, Mr. Stember, who is a fashion photographer, gives us a good deal less than meets the eye or the ear in this ill-defined and disconnected saga of a modern young man's angst in a world rent by wars and other dissensions.Mr. Stember, who produced and directed from his story and for his own company, SHA Productions, apparently was uncertain about just how he would project the problems endured by his vaguely limned but highly distraught hero.What we're exposed to is a series of vignettes photographed in color against mostly local backgrounds that give the impression of having been tossed in merely to indicate progressive anxieties.The anxieties appear to have basis in awesome facts. We see televised scenes indicating Hitler's holocausts, and others, up to and including Vietnam. Vietnam is what appears to have set off our troubled pettish hero, Alan Midgette. In disjointed scenes, he is oddly unresponsive to the pleas of his nude, beautiful but callow wife (Phoebe McAdams) to come to bed; to his loquacious, divorced mother (Ruth Ford) and her saccharine adoration, and to a vague, older friend (Paul Gallan), who, at one point, chases him desperately as he rows down a sylvan stream.Unfortunately, Mr. Midgette, a lank-haired, slightly delicate blond type sporting a flowing white scarf, is given to long, moody silences and few words that convey coherency or depth. In a reflective sequence shot for no real reason on a windswept beach through waving weeds, his Vietnam observations include, ""Those are real babies crying, this war is a crime against nature.""The dialogue, done in an ad lib, Andy Warhol technique, is not a crime against nature but it does little to put the principals in sharp focus. Nor does it do much for the meaning of the climax, which has our tortured Alan fleeing inexplicably from everyone at an airport.The title, ""7254,"" a program note says, is the ""Kodak designation for color negative film."" Well, it wasn't used especially positively this time.",Review,By A. H. Weiler,Archives,,[]

The present victim of society's evils is an 18‐year‐old youth, emptied of illusions by two‐years’ combat service in Vietnam. (He lied about his age to enlist.) Terry Foxway comes back from the war a tabula rasa, void of all excess psychological baggage except his pragmatic conditioning for survival. The good old U.S.A. has a fine opportunity to write some nice things into Terry's personality, but everyone plays him false: his girl, his teach ers, his employers, the VIP's who admire his war record. From his parents he learns only an oppressive sense of empti ness. (“It was as if they had misplaced their lives.”)",Archives,,Archives,,[]

The Screen:'Last Valley' Recalls a Story of Survival,1971-01-29,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/29/archives/the-screenlast-valley-recalls-a-story-of-survival.html,article,"""The Last Valley"" is a kind of historical movie, a type of adventure drama, a sort of epic, and something of a parable, and it winds up being a bit more boring than is absolutely necessary, considering the possibilities.Experiencing the movie is very much like riding in a big, handsome, old Rolls-Royce that keeps wandering from one side of the road to the other, slipping its gears, speeding up and then suddenly breaking — all because the driver doesn't know where he's going or how fast he wants to get there, although it's apparent he wants to travel in all of the style that money can buy.The driver is James Clavell, the novelist (""King Rat"") and film writer-director (""To Sir, With Love""), who wrote, directed and produced this adaption of J. B. Pick's 1960 novel set against the background of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which was almost an anthology of war.Beginning as a rebellion of Protestant German princes against the Catholic Habsburgs, it evolved, over the decades, into a series of see-saw battles, mixed alliances and desperate power plays involving France, England, Spain, Denmark and Sweden, in addition to Austria and the German states. By the time the Treaty of Westphalia was signed, most of Germany had been devastated and about the only thing that had been accomplished was the irrevocable end of the Holy Roman Empire, which was dead anyway.""The Last Valley"" is a rather dreamlike story of survival set in a magnificent valley protected from the outside world by high mountains. Into this valley comes Vogel (Omar Sharif), a one-time school teacher who has been on the run for years, followed shortly afterwards by a small, exhausted army led by the Captain (Michael Caine), whose men kill and burn and rape on reflex and have long since forgotten what they're fighting for.The Captain, using Vogel as a go-between, effects a truce with the people of the valley, pledging to protect them from invasion in return for food, shelter and women for the winter, at the end of which the Captain goes off to fight another battle and Vogel is evicted, to continue his wanderings. The people of the valley survive, simply by enduring.Like Bertolt Brecht in ""Mother Courage,"" Mr. Clavell, I suspect, sees the incredible horrors of the Thirty Years' War as a metaphor for contemporary horrors, but he seems either incapable of—or uninterested in—developing a physical drama with any kind of intellectual substructure. Vogel, a pragmatic dreamer, and the Captain, a career soldier whose cynicism is not quite complete, talk quite a lot about war and religion but the quality of their dialogue would not embarrass the folks on ""Gunsmoke."" When, in the spring, the Captain departs to engage in yet another battle, the outcome of which will make no difference to anybody, all he can say is that he must go to the battle ""because it's there.""So much money was obviously spent on the lavish production—on scenery, costumes, occasional battles and extras—that I suspect Mr. Clavell thought he was making a statement about civilization, and perhaps even Vietnam, that would somehow work as an action melodrama. Although Mr. Clavell, as a writer, has nothing in common with Shaw, ""The Last Valley"" kept reminding me of Guy Hamilton's misguided attempts some years ago to turn ""The Devil's Disciple"" into a popcorn movie.It's difficult to judge Mr. Clavell's effect on his performers, except to remark that Mr. Sharif and Mr. Caine, who've never struck me as especially subtle actors, are quite good, while Per Oscarsson (""Hunger""), who is, I think, a great actor, seems to be acting up a storm in a dramatic vacuum. It may be, however, that in his make-up as a slightly mad Catholic priest he looks just a little too much like Charles Manson.One technical point: the film, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and Juliet 2 Theaters, favors such slow lap dissolves that you will spend what seems like most of the movie seeing double images.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

The Screen,1971-09-24,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/24/archives/the-screen.html,article,"Felix Greene, the British cameraman-journalist-author, who gave us feature-length color close-ups of ""China!"" in 1965 and ""North Vietnam"" two years later, continues his role as a movie Marco Polo for the embattled Left in ""Cuba Va!"", his latest color documentary on a nation largely concealed by a ""curtain."" As in the previous cases, he illustrates a contented people, who admittedly haven't yet achieved their revolutionary goals but are, as the title translates, moving forward.Using some old black-and-white footage to stress the enrichment of the few wealthy, both local and foreign, and the deprivation of the masses of the poor and ignorant Latin Americans, Greene, who shot his color film over the last year or so, makes visual comparisons in generally calm and effective style.With Premier Fidel Castro appearing on a few occasions to explain that Cuban freedom could be achieved only by revolution after 400 years of foreign domination, the film's natural bias is apparent but not overpowering. It opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema.The ""85 per cent"" illiteracy that existed 12 years ago when Castro ousted the former dictator, Fulgencio Batista, is given cheerful counterpoint by happy youngsters and adults receiving free education and instruction in trades in various immaculate up-to-date urban and rural schools. The admitted fact that did not meet its 10-million-ton sugar cane goal last year is offset by various scenes showing the harvesting of eight and a half million tons, a record crop.A viewer is fascinated by workers from other areas chipping in voluntarily to help with the cane, tobacco and other harvests; by a fine teachers college, medical school with many distaff students, and an especially modern psychiatric hospital near Havana; by an orchestra devoted to Western classics that is viewed, somewhat less favorably, than an excellent modern dance team working with native rhythms as another sign of Cuba's socialistic approach to the arts.One is impressed by younger composer-guitarists such as Silvio Rodriguez, Noel Nicola and Pablo Milanes, whose fine voices extol their brave new world. And one assumes that Mr. Greene knows what he is talking about in noting that ""the cinemas are filled and a nightclub has to be booked weeks in advance.""One also get glimpses of modern highways being built and slums being razed and a climactic scene showing Cubans reacting forcefully in Havana demonstrations when their captive fishermen were freed by Americans last year. The over-all impression sought by Mr. Greene is a bright present and a brighter future. But despite his largely happy vistas, his ""Cuba Va!"" leaves a nagging feeling that it is only a partial view of current history that still desperately needs fuller explanations.Also on the bill is ""Reggae,"" a 60-minute documentary on Jamaican music filmed at a concert in London last year and intercut with observations on its origins and purposes. As an outgrowth of traditional African, calypso, rock, soul and blues, its beat is infectious.And, even though Mike Raven, a British disk jockey, explains that ""Reggae"" was the name of the first record label to feature that genre and that it is also a form of protest, it is basically an item for the buffs, who should appreciate it most.",Review,By A.

Screen: Coutard Focuses on Vietnam in 'Hoa-Binh':Rhetoric of War Fades in Face of Reality Boy Left to Find Way in a Scarred World,1971-08-23,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/23/archives/screen-coutard-focuses-on-vietnam-in-hoabinhrhetoric-of-war-fades.html,article,"Among cinematographers younger than 50 there is probably none more internationally famous or more justly famous than Raoul Coutard, who has photographed most of the greatest films of François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. So highly is Coutard regarded that some critics unfriendly to the French New Wave have speculated that the real genius behind films like ""Une Femme Est une Femme"" and ""La Chinoise"" was the photographer and not the director at all. For this line of reasoning to be laid to rest, I suppose it would be necessary for Coutard to make his own movie, and this he has now done. It is called ""Hoa-Binh,"" and it opened yesterday at the Lincoln Art Theater.In many respects it is very much a photographer's movie. Looking not at all like Truffaut or Godard, it is full of muted colors, striking images that seem to have been included for their own sake, and details held in splendid isolation — as the camera rather than the eye might see them. All of which gives ""Hoa-Binh"" a curiously old-fashioned and rather artlessly handsome look not entirely inconsistent with the moods of its story—which is, however, set in the midst of the modern and unlovely reality of contemporary South Vietnam.Although it was made under the shadow of, and is necessarily about, the war in Vietnam, ""Hoa-Binh"" goes to almost excruciating lengths to avoid propagandistic persuasion. And although its locations are actual and its actors mostly amateur, it has a story, and its reality is the reality of fiction and not of documentary.The hero is named Hung, an 11-year-old boy whose father goes off to join the Vietcong and whose mother shortly afterward is hospitalized with terminal cancer. The sole protector of his baby sister, Hung soon leaves the unfriendly cousin with whom he has been placed and begins to make his way in the young-people's free-enterprise world of Saigon. He tries his hand at stevedoring and gambling, at which he does well; and at shoe-shining and newspaper-selling, at which he does badly.In general, the children's fortunes decline, but in the knick of time a nurse, a total stranger, takes them in, gives Hung shelter, gets him a job, and places the baby in a nursery. Meanwhile from the North, Hung's father begins a journey home, to deliver messages and to begin again with what is left of his family.I'm not sure that any movie based on a fiction so limited and, in a sense, so gratuitous, could be wholly satisfactory. ""Hoa-Binh"" adds to its simplicities a kind of hapless awkwardness in execution, in the mechanics of simply carrying a scene through. And at the same time it introduces ideological material—a humane justification of the American presence overheard from an Army sergeant while Hung shines his shoes; an organizer's lucid promise of Vietcong victory while United States jets roar overhead—that it is not really prepared to digest except in terms of obvious ironic illustration of the futility of high thought in a world of low feeling and of intensely personal privations.But ""Hoa-Binh"" ultimately succeeds beneath the play of ideology, and despite its structural crudities, and even despite the indulgences that Coutard sometimes allows his camera. For it is a deeply honorable work, as honorable in its refusal to place blame as in its decency in the face of human suffering. In this it achieves a moral reticence that approaches asceticism and that is as beautiful to watch in the movies as anywhere else.You can see it most clearly perhaps in the lovely performances of Phi Lan as Hung and Xuan Ha as his young mother. If you watch their eyes you will see that their looks and glances, wonderful in themselves, are used not to externalize suffering and so engage the audience's sympathy, but to communicate and so build a world of shared understanding—even though that understanding may include not only love but also fear and hate.The result is a self-sufficiency that begs no responses, but that is moving in some of the ways that film can be moving—without at the same time losing its bearings and pretending that it is life. Anyone can imagine a dozen movies about Vietnam, full of searing indictments and heartbreaking revelations. But ""Hoa-Binh"" is none of these. With all its faults it is something very much better, more complete, more secret, more genuinely in touch with the mysteries of human perception.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
