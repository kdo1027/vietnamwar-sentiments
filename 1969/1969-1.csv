Screen: A Gentle and Humble Godard:Belmondo Plays Pierrot to Anna Karina,1969-01-09,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/09/archives/screen-a-gentle-and-humble-godardbelmondo-plays-pierrot-to-anna.html,article,"""PIERROT LE FOU,"" which opened yesterday at the 72d Street Theater, is one of the humblest and most gentle of Jean-Luc Godard's films. Shot in 1965, before the cracks in the young French director's composure really opened up, the film has seams, murders, auto accidents, political harangues. The hero ultimately wraps his head in dynamite and blows himself to bits. But Pierrot is the ""mon ami, Pierrot"" from ""Au Claire de la Lune"" (a song that occurs uninsistently in the score), and a lot of the film's imagery is of the moon and gentle lunacy. It is in part a delicate, sentimental love story, a little on the order of Truffaut.Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Pierrot, a writer whose girl calls him Pierrot, but whose real name, Ferdinand, is emblazoned on his sweatshirt. (He and the film have some of the sweet loser's ironies of Charlie Brown.) The girl is played by Anna Karina, Mr. Godard's first wife, and no film has ever been more loving in its treatment of a star. Miss Karina makes her particular case for life, clothes, dancing, fields, skies, love and a little violence, and the writer makes his abstract case for ""Ambition, love, the movement of things, accidents — everything."" They have an affair near the sea, with a fox and a parrot for company. They speak of Bernardin de St. Pierre's innocent ""Paul et Virginie."" They despair of each other.They also have some ""Breathless""-style adventures, with many references to Laurel and Hardy, ""Johnny Guitar,"" Michel Simon, ""Pepe le Moko"" and other cinema presences that are exigently real to the imagination of Godard. The film requires a little patience as it goes its own erratic way. One long drive by night down a highway, with colored lights (the film, shot by Raoul Coutard, is in color) flashing incessantly across the hood and windshield is particularly trying in its affectation. So are the strainings to include a bit of Vietnam and politics. (When Godard is bad, he is terrible:) And the film generates a certain impatience in its oddly felt absence of any scene of sex.But there is so much that is whimsical and beautiful: Pierrot, painting his face blue before he dies, and fumbling, at the last moment, for the fuse; Miss Karina, parodying musicals, unaffectedly singing (the music, ranging from Beethoven to Duhamel, is a careful, thoughtout comment on the script); an incredible, isolated piece of highway overpass abandoned in a field; Mr. Belmondo putting mustard on an immense piece of cheese, during an authentic, cinéma vérité—interview with a frowzy old eccentric who thinks she is the exiled queen of Lebanon; Jean-Pierre Leaud, appearing for one instant, looking baleful, on the screen; a kind of Brechtian bitter, fine misuse of American frames of references, in the ""Oh, Moon of Alabama"" style; a superb comic turn, about love and refrains in the head, by the Belgian actor Raymond Devos.The film is poetic, quiet, introverted, personal. The writer and Miss Karina have funny, despairing things to say to each other. There is no bravado in the part Belmondo plays this time, or any real violence in Miss Karina's. They are both charming and fed up, an Idiom that sounds richer in French and that is applied in the film to everyone, including the man in the moon. One moving thing is that a director as proud and forceful, as annihilatingly positivist as Godard should make a film this tentative and forbearing about an artist and his girl in love.",Review,"By Renata Adler, Howard Thompson",Archives,,[]
