Screen: Coutard Focuses on Vietnam in 'Hoa-Binh':Rhetoric of War Fades in Face of Reality Boy Left to Find Way in a Scarred World,1971-08-23,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/23/archives/screen-coutard-focuses-on-vietnam-in-hoabinhrhetoric-of-war-fades.html,article,"Among cinematographers younger than 50 there is probably none more internationally famous or more justly famous than Raoul Coutard, who has photographed most of the greatest films of François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. So highly is Coutard regarded that some critics unfriendly to the French New Wave have speculated that the real genius behind films like ""Une Femme Est une Femme"" and ""La Chinoise"" was the photographer and not the director at all. For this line of reasoning to be laid to rest, I suppose it would be necessary for Coutard to make his own movie, and this he has now done. It is called ""Hoa-Binh,"" and it opened yesterday at the Lincoln Art Theater.In many respects it is very much a photographer's movie. Looking not at all like Truffaut or Godard, it is full of muted colors, striking images that seem to have been included for their own sake, and details held in splendid isolation — as the camera rather than the eye might see them. All of which gives ""Hoa-Binh"" a curiously old-fashioned and rather artlessly handsome look not entirely inconsistent with the moods of its story—which is, however, set in the midst of the modern and unlovely reality of contemporary South Vietnam.Although it was made under the shadow of, and is necessarily about, the war in Vietnam, ""Hoa-Binh"" goes to almost excruciating lengths to avoid propagandistic persuasion. And although its locations are actual and its actors mostly amateur, it has a story, and its reality is the reality of fiction and not of documentary.The hero is named Hung, an 11-year-old boy whose father goes off to join the Vietcong and whose mother shortly afterward is hospitalized with terminal cancer. The sole protector of his baby sister, Hung soon leaves the unfriendly cousin with whom he has been placed and begins to make his way in the young-people's free-enterprise world of Saigon. He tries his hand at stevedoring and gambling, at which he does well; and at shoe-shining and newspaper-selling, at which he does badly.In general, the children's fortunes decline, but in the knick of time a nurse, a total stranger, takes them in, gives Hung shelter, gets him a job, and places the baby in a nursery. Meanwhile from the North, Hung's father begins a journey home, to deliver messages and to begin again with what is left of his family.I'm not sure that any movie based on a fiction so limited and, in a sense, so gratuitous, could be wholly satisfactory. ""Hoa-Binh"" adds to its simplicities a kind of hapless awkwardness in execution, in the mechanics of simply carrying a scene through. And at the same time it introduces ideological material—a humane justification of the American presence overheard from an Army sergeant while Hung shines his shoes; an organizer's lucid promise of Vietcong victory while United States jets roar overhead—that it is not really prepared to digest except in terms of obvious ironic illustration of the futility of high thought in a world of low feeling and of intensely personal privations.But ""Hoa-Binh"" ultimately succeeds beneath the play of ideology, and despite its structural crudities, and even despite the indulgences that Coutard sometimes allows his camera. For it is a deeply honorable work, as honorable in its refusal to place blame as in its decency in the face of human suffering. In this it achieves a moral reticence that approaches asceticism and that is as beautiful to watch in the movies as anywhere else.You can see it most clearly perhaps in the lovely performances of Phi Lan as Hung and Xuan Ha as his young mother. If you watch their eyes you will see that their looks and glances, wonderful in themselves, are used not to externalize suffering and so engage the audience's sympathy, but to communicate and so build a world of shared understanding—even though that understanding may include not only love but also fear and hate.The result is a self-sufficiency that begs no responses, but that is moving in some of the ways that film can be moving—without at the same time losing its bearings and pretending that it is life. Anyone can imagine a dozen movies about Vietnam, full of searing indictments and heartbreaking revelations. But ""Hoa-Binh"" is none of these. With all its faults it is something very much better, more complete, more secret, more genuinely in touch with the mysteries of human perception.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
