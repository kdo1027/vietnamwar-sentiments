Rostow has written some good books. This is not one of them. Rostow, who served as an adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, 1961‐69, proposes to write the his tory of the years 1957‐72, as one who has had a hand in making it. This is a perfectly legitimate under taking whose ancestry stretches from Thucydides and Julius Caesar to Churchill and Eisenhower. Others, such as Bismarck, have left us a kind of political autobiography by record ing their part in the events and re flecting upon it. Rostow has done neither but has combined the two.The hybrid form, of which this book is neither the first nor likely to be the last example, is bound to make for bad history. For the discipline of the historians' craft within which the historian must labor is vitiated by the author's concern to make sure that the reader does not miss the role he has played, and to justify it. Thus the perspective from which his tory is viewed becomes distorted. What ought to be at the periphery is moved into the center, and what is placed in the center could not pos sibly have been so central as it is made to appear. Much that deserves mention in a work of history is not mentioned at all, and some in formation is so trivial as to be out of place even in an autobiography.Thus we are told that the author was in his bath when President John son called him, and that President elect Kennedy came out of his bath when Rostow called upon him. I do not doubt that these are facts, but they certainly are not historic facts because they are of no interest to posterity. Twice Rostow quotes from remarks he made at a Pugwash Con ference, and he tells us what he said at the debriefing and that he was invited to dinner by one of the Rus sian participants. Many of us have had repeatedly similar experiences without being conscious of their his toric or even autobiographical signif icance. With Vietnam on his mind, Rostow tells us: “I left the White House just before noon on Jan. 2, 1969 with the hope that Nixon would decide to stay the course.” One al most sees darkness at noon closing in on the President's mansion.",Archives,By Hans J.
