' Eight' and 'Three',1969-06-19,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/06/19/archives/eight-and-three.html,article,"SURE, Vietnam and primaries can plague a body. But ""The Devil's Eight"" and ""Killers Three"" loudly prove that in the South, where moonshiners and revenuers still don't mix, we've got a real problem, especially for moviegoers who value their hearing. The hillbillies and other hard types who crashed onto local screens yesterday expend enough muscle and firepower to take Omaha Beach in a pair of elementary adventures as flimsy as cartoons.""Killers Three,"" which makes a vague pass at mountain folklore, has Robert Walker, son of the late actor and Jennifer Jones; Dick Clark, the platter spinner and darling of TV's teen-aged swingers, and Diane Varsi running afoul of the law just after World War II. Seems that Mr. Walker, who doesn't want to haul illicit corn likker no more, tries to steal $200,000 from his boss's safe, with the aid of his wife, Miss Varsi, and of his pal, Clark. They'll all go to California with the loot, where, it says here, the living is easier.Well, it doesn't work and, while our harried trio, according to the background song, ""never meant to kill anyone,"" they leave a pretty bloody trail for the posse to follow. Miss Varsi wistfully loves her little boy, but chooses to follow her man and gets shot for her devotion. Mr. Walker, strikingly reminiscent of his late father in appearance, is simply phlegmatic more often than not. And Mr. Clark, wearing glasses, a mustache and a doleful expression that fits his laconic dialogue, is mowed down in the climactic battle, which, of course, has no connection with the fact that he's also the film's producer.""The Devil's Eight"" are, for the record, a crew of roadgang convicts, surrepitiously freed by Federal agent Christopher George to get the goods on moonshiner Ralph Meeker and governmental higher-ups on the take. Their training would be worthy of commandos versed in brawling, breakneck car handling, grenade throwing, machine gunning and sundry diversions. It's enough to make a man forget about booze and movie making.The carnage among these unshaven hard guys is continuous, as is the action, under rudimentary direction.Despite the gunfire and the clangorous country-and-West-ern musical backgrounds, ""The Devil's Eight"" and ""Killers Three"" merely illustrate that a viewer is shortchanged in these versions of the numbers game.",Review,A.
