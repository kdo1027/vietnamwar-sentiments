We refer to the fact that the Arab “revolutionaries” [at first] al towed non‐Jewish women and Children to leave the captive planes and go to a hotel in Amman, while forcing all Jew ish women and children‐The Geneva Conference re jected Washington's terms and Washington was compelled to pledge not to disturb the ac cords, acknowledging’ its U.N. obligation to respect Vietnam's territorial integrity and inde pendence. But it had already initiated unilaterally its policy of partition and of imposing Diem upon the south. Disregarding the Conference accords, the will of the Viet namese, its own pledge and the U.N. Charter, it has persisted right up to the present in trying to disrupt Vietnam's territorial integrity and to yoke the south with unsavory, unpopular re‐gimes. The absence of enforcement powers does not exempt na tions from the obligations of international law, nor does it modify the criminal character of our war in Vietnam as juridi cally defined at Nuremberg. Moreover, the lawlessness of U.S. behavior in Indochina does not place Mr. Nixon in a posi tion to exhort Americans to respect law at home. His only course now consistent with law is to get out of Vietnam, and to leave political resolution tothe Vietnamese and the inter national community.Max GORDON New York, Aug. 1970‐Cease‐Fire Opposed To the Editor: Your Aug. 30 editorial “Talk or Talk‐Fight in Vietnam”urged that the Unite& States propose a standstill cease‐fire.
