The Screen: 'Greetings' on 34th Street:Issues of Day Treated in Comic-Strip Style,1968-12-16,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/16/archives/the-screen-greetings-on-34th-streetissues-of-day-treated-in.html,article,"THE idea of a kind of comic-strip movie romp satirically thrusting at certain aspects of the American scene somehow seems apt during the holiday season. But ""Greetings,"" a free-wheeling exercise put together by a group of chaps in their 20's, is way off target. This modest but blandly assured little picture, nimbly photographed in good color, opened yesterday at the 34th Street East Theater.What we have here is a trio of hippie-talking pals adventurously prowling the streets of New York and New Jersey, linking up with a succession of enigmatic girls and aiming some splintery, incoherent monologues at each other and, occasionally, the camera. Some of it is amusing, as when one of the lads is coached in the technique of draft-dodging. Most of it is strained and unfunny, with some generous nudity for nudity's sake and a hip sprinkling of four-letter words.One subject of mockery is President Johnson, who is shown in a newsreel clip defending his position on Vietnam. And a smirking actor named Gerritt Graham prances through the picture trying to disprove the findings of the Warren Commission. A typical disgusting scene shows him using a nude girl to tape-measure a simulated bullet trajectory.Of his pals, Robert De Niro and Jonathan Warden, the latter gives at least some evidence of a little talent. There's no doubt that young Brian De Palma, who directed, and Charles Hirsch, his producer, are determined and camera-minded. Next time they might try for something that matters instead of the tired, tawdry and tattered.",Review,HOWARD THOMPSON,Archives,,[]

Screen: Bergman's Fable About War:Liv Ullmann Stars With Von Sydow in 'Shame',1968-12-24,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/24/archives/screen-bergmans-fable-about-warliv-ullmann-stars-with-von-sydow-in.html,article,"""SHAME,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is Ingmar Bergman's fable about war. Dry, beautifully photographed, almost arid in its inspiration, it concerns a couple of former musicians, Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow, who are caught on an island in the middle of an insurrection in 1971. They are not getting on well, they do not care who wins, and even the war fails to intensify anything about their lives. Von Sydow is a coward, increasingly debased as the film and the war go on by his completely unheroic, now virtually incomprehensible, determination to remain alive.The ""Shame"" of the title is God's. ""What if that person should wake up one morning and be ashamed of what he had done?"" one of the characters says. ""That person"" is God. The war is no longer a moral context. It is part of the order of things, the sides are not defined, no one is responsible for it. Bergman has moved, exhausted, straight out of the human condition to take on the universe again. He is getting to be the Job of directors, in the tired, outraged realm at the edge of things where there is nothing to be said.Against the dull, authentic pounding of guns, Miss Ullmann and Von Sydow are rounded up, first by one side (for a dubbed, forged interview of solidarity), then by the other (to be abused for the interview). They become friends, for all the good it does them, with a colonel, Gunnar Bjornstrand, whom Miss Ullmann sleeps with, in a kind of tribute to his desperation. They take ferries on their nameless island very like—in their quotidian indifference to the soldiers aboard, the war around—the ferries in the delta of Vietnam.Miss Ullmann, in her wish to have a baby, her impatience with her lover's lack of courage, her kindness to strangers, Is the only one still grounded in any humanity at all. By the end, they set off in a boat through a sea littered with military corpses for the mainland or another island, where, presumably, there will be another war. ""Shame"" could be a film about the tenacity of civilians, but it is more like a document just before extinction. There is no strength in it. It is at Bergman's wits' end. Even the idea that a childless couple would go to such limits of energy simply not to die is not self-evident or even convincing any more.",Review,By Renata Adler,Archives,,[]

Screen: Upbeat Musical:'Monterey Pop' Views the Rock Scene,1968-12-27,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/27/archives/screen-upbeat-musicalmonterey-pop-views-the-rock-scene.html,article,"""MONTEREY POP,"" which was shown last night at Lincoln Center and which will open early in January at the Kips Bay Theater, is a contemporary music film—in the relatively fresh tradition of ""Festival"" and ""Don't Look Back."" The movie, filmed by Richard Leacock and D. A. Pennebaker, with the collaboration of Albert Maysles and other independent filmmakers, is an upbeat, color documentary of the 1967 pop-music festival in Monterey, Calif. It stars the Mamas and the Papas, the Jefferson Airplane, Ravi Shankar, the Who and other singing groups. From the moment Scott Mackenzie's ""If you're going to San Francisco"" comes onto the track and screen, it is clear that this is one good way to do a musical.There is all that shiny hair, orangeade, beautiful hands, shades, watermelon, shoeless feet in tights, flowers papers, dogs, the wrinkled bottom of Ravi Shankar's tapping foot, psychedelic blobs behind the podium, smoke effects behind the infernal Who, mouths approaching microphones, eyes in all those various, distinct, serious young faces, which—10 years ago, before the seriousness of Vietnam began—we didn't seem to have. The photography is pretty well coordinated with the sound, sometimes blinded by strobe lights, so that the screen goes absolutely white, sometimes shifting down lines of audience in a kind of ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" focus of attention on characters other than the main.There are the lyrical songs, ""California Dreamin'"" and Simon and Garfunkel's ""Feeling Groovy."" Janis Joplin straining her voice and being to sing black. Then there is a kind of spot, purely visual interview — a beard and a cop laughing, wordlessly teasing each other; a girl from Champaign, Ill., feeling lucky to be allowed to wipe the folding chairs between performances, a Hell's Angel arriving at the Shankar concert that is the long, wound up climax of the film. There are rock violinists and young people dressed like pageant potentates.""We all love each other, right?"" Otis Redding shouts, half ironic, half intimidating. ""Right,"" the audience replies. Jimmie Hendrix goes through his thing of somersaulting, then being irreverently, frantically obscene with his guitar, finally destroying it—presaging in a fairly violent way, the quality of the kisses of Tiny Tim.But the nicest thing about the movie is not its musical or nostalgic qualities, but the way it captures the pop musical willingness to hurl yourself into things, without all the What If (What if I can't? What if I make a fool of myself?) joy action-stopping self-consciousness of an earlier generation, a willingness that can somehow co-exist with the idea of cool. Also, musically and photographically, the harmonies, the resolutions of chaos after everything looks as though it is going to fall apart.""Once you leave here you may not re-enter,"" a guard at the festival says to some members of the audience at the gate. It is possible that the way to a new kind of musical—using some of the talent and energy of what is still the most lively contemporary medium—may begin with just this kind of musical performance documentary.",Review,By Renata Adler,Archives,,[]
