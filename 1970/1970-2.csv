In what used to be normal times, this was natural enough. Before World War II, the peacetime military establishment was small and com posed entirely of regulars—a caste that tended to be distinct from the rest of the population. Its officers came from West Point or Annapolis, married the daughters of other regu lars and sent their sons to West Point or Annapolis. Enlisted men got drunk on payday and drunker at the expira tion of every hitch, after which they staggered back to the post and re enlisted. When they landed in the brig or guardhouse, which was fre quently, the civilian public cared about the fairness of the proceedings no more than it cared about the system of criminal justice applicable to other foreigners, such as Chinese coolies. Neither the Supreme Court nor anyone else ever supposed that the Bill of Rights applied to soldiers. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase said in 1867 that “the power of Congress in the government of the land and naval forces ... is not at all affected by the Fifth or any other amend ment,” and the proposition was scarcely challenged until after World War II.",Archives,By Joseph W.
