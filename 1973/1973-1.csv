At the time of Guernica, Warsaw, Rotterdam and Coventry what raised the world's conscience with a sacred horror was the recurrence, by the will of one man and his military advisers, of the most barbarous, the cruelest, the most horrifying, the most homicidal means to win a political design.

The world fought five years against that, against the incredible return of forgotten practices, that one thought had disappeared forever. America was not the least fierce nor the least sincere in that struggle to establish between nations a minimum of civilized relations. It was America which by its initiative (the creation of the U.N.) showed most visibly that will of healing.

Screen: 'Death of a Jew':Farce on Israeli-Arab Espionage Opens The Cast,1973-01-18,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/18/archives/screen-death-of-a-jewfarce-on-israeliarab-espionage-opens-the-cast.html,article,"With a title like ""Death of a Jew,"" you almost don't need a movie. And in Denys de la Patalliere's ""Death of a Jew,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, you almost don't have one. What you do have is an incredible story, told in moving pictures, about a tender relationship between an old Arab police inspector (the late Akim Tamiroff) and a young Israeli spy (Assaf Dayan). The newspaper ads quote one critic as saying that the story ""can be appreciated by Arabs as well as Israelis."" And I am afraid that an ecumenism at just that level of naiveté, is what ""Death of a Jew"" is all about.Shimon, the Israeli spy, is captured deep inside some unidentified Arab country, and, to make him reveal his contacts he is turned over to the police. When all else fails, even the evil technology of the police chief (Jean Claudio: ""It's not a question of courage; it's a question of voltage."" Sneer.), the old inspector, Mehdaloun, gets his licks.Mehdaloun hopes to replace Shimon's silence with a gregarious will to live, and thus to talk (so as to stay alive); and to this end he sets about corrupting him with kindness. He plies Shimon with gifts; rooms him in his own apartment; takes him eating, drinking, whoring; and grows so fond of his enemy that he begins calling him ""my son.""It is all to no avail. Shimon remains tight as a clam. But, irony of ironies, Mehdaloun falls prey to his own scheme! And he is left at the last, entering his dotage, with a new gregarious will to live—not to mention extravagant tastes for room service, vodka straight and compliant Scandinavian blondes.All this is not quite as stupid as it may seem in the abstract. Anyplace but the Middle East (and perhaps North and South Vietnam) it might have furnished a movie plot. A friend, intelligent and much too kind, has suggested analogies all the way from Claude Berri's ""The Two of Us"" to Bergman's ""Persona."" Personally, I am put more in mind of certain Shirley Temple movies; but any plot idea that has floated so far must have some buoyancy to sustain it.Assaf Dayan and Akim Tamiroff have been highly engaging actors, but they are both pretty dreadful here. The film is in English, which Tamiroff speaks with a Yiddish accent (somewhat unsettling, under the circumstances), and which all the others speak as if they had learned it at school in France. Denys de la Patalliere, (""Taxi for Tobruk,"" ""Marco the Magnificent"") directs as if he hadn't learned anything at all. ""Death of a Jew"" is the kind of film that seems to advance from scene to scene not by any inner necessity, but rather because everybody at a particular time in a particular place finds himself at a loss for what to do next.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

Screen: Wives in 'Limbo':Robson Views P.O.W. Families at Festival,1973-01-27,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/27/archives/screen-wives-in-limborobson-views-pow-families-at-festival.html,article,"If it has nothing else — and Mark Robson's ""Limbo"" hasn't — you might at least expect topicality of a film about the problems facing wives of American servicemen who are either missing in action in Vietnam or prisoners of war. By using something less than the sheerest art, Robson manages to make this story (""torn from today's headlines,"" we are told) resemble any number of dreadful World War II tearjerkers.""Interestingly, however, ""Limbo"" does demonstrate the impotency of so much of the liberal opposition to the war that is now, apparently, coming to an end.Robson is, I take it, a liberal. He certainly was back in the late ninteen-forties when he directed such films as ""Champion"" and ""Home of The Brave.""In that optimistic time, political and social issues were clear cut. War against bigotry was simply an extension of the war against Hitler. It was cosily patriotic. The good, voting liberal had not yet had to wrestle with the unruly, rising consciousnesses of all sorts of impatient groups, with, for example, the new black philosophy that says to hell with integration, we'll do it by ourselves.A lot of liberals lost heart in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. It is not fun being ridiculed by the people you had always wanted to protect. Robson, for reasons of his own, has devoted most of his later career to big-budget nonsense on the order of ""Peyton Place,"" ""Von Ryan's Express"" and ""Valley of The Dolls."" Watching ""Limbo,"" you can speculate why.The mind that made it is, I suspect, outraged by the war but seems afraid to say so. It is as split in mood as a lot of other people may be split in their sympathies — feeling sorrow for the American P.O.W. fliers, yet overwhelmed by fury with those who continued to go on bombing missions.The liberals protested but mostly with a politeness born, I think, out of memories of World War II, and even Korea, when wars were declared and the stakes were easy to define. There is a similar liberal sort of politeness in 'Limbo,"" which is as obvious in its narrative structure and physical look as in anything that anyone says.The screenplay, by Joan Silver and James Bridges, set on an Air Force base in Florida, is about three wives who are three points of view, good, bad and all mixed-up.The good wife (Kathleen Nolan) is middle-aged, Catholic, the mother of four, faithful to her husband and angry about the war.The bad one (Katherine Justice) is rich, beautiful, Southern, an all-out patriot and so spoiled that she refuses to believe the eyewitness report of her husband's death.The confused one is Kate Jackson, married only two weeks before her husband's departure, and now hopelessly in love with a nice, honorable, out-of-work space technician.The situations are real enough, but Robson entombs them in a lot of bogus domestic complications, photographed and acted in a simplistic romantic style that denies any sense of real topicality and urgency. If Vietnam were a war like any other (which it is not), there might be a small point to this approach.Only occasionally does the film seem to be about a special, very confused moment in history, but Robson tends to flub these moments too, as in the sequence in which three American wives visit the North Vietnamese embassy in Paris. He opens the sequence with some nice old chop-chop music that 40 years ago used to identify a stock shot of wicked Shanghai.Robson's heart is in the right place, but his movie is unimaginative, phony and ineffectual. It opened yesterday at the Festival.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
