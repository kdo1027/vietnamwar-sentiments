Screen:' David Holzman Diary' Spoofs Cinema Verite,1973-12-07,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/07/archives/screen-david-holzman-diary-spoofs-cinema-verite.html,article,"""Life as a work of art""—at least once a decade that ancient concept seduces some members of yet another generation, and inspires them to hash up their lives in the name of truth or beauty. Jim McBride's ""David Holzman's Diary,"" a totally delightful satire on ""the blubber about cinéma vérité,"" mocks those ghastly reels from the nineteen-sixties, when various film makers immortalized themselves or their friends by trying and failing to be spontaneous. ""Diary,"" which derides directors who scorned imagination or invention while worshiping the camera, opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art.Holzman, an earnest young Godard-hound, decides to film his life in order to understand it—and only succeeds in ruining it. As a voyeur, a gentle intruder into other people's lives, he can't understand that the filming makes his subjects feel self-conscious, or that ""reality"" is altered by the presence of his camera and his tape recorder and his lavalier mike, which he calls his ""friends.""His girlfriend, who detests his movie-making, finally leaves him because of it. He's already told us in a dry, flat voice that he really loves her, though he can't resist pointing out that she's ""dirty, sloppy."" Forlornly, he adds, ""I don't quite get her sense of privacy."" After she's gone, he argues that masturbation is an improvement on the real thing because You can think of anything . . . pigs. Think of trains going in tunnels. Think of bagels. I mean, you're not limited to women.""However, his obsession with freezing everything on celluloid rarely allows him any other fantasies. He gives manic attention to every detail of his New York neighborhood, from derelict sofas on the street to the installation of matchstick bamboo blinds in a nearby apartment, and finally gets slugged by a cop for filming people through their windows.Soon, we realize that the camera is his analyst. He tells it everything, and then grows furious because it doesn't answer him with ""the right things,"" and also makes him ""do things"" that he wouldn't ordinarily do. Accusingly, he asks it, ""What do you want?"" Then he shouts at the lens that it hasn't helped him—just as a frustrated patient may denounce an all too silent psychiatrist.""Diary"" was made in 1967, and time has served it very well. We get a pungent flash on the past when a radio announces the numbers killed in the Newark riots, or refers to ""the new Israel-Egyptian cease-fire,"" or quotes the Pentagon on the probable increase of American forces in Vietnam next year. But aside from politics, that period now seems a rather innocent one in retrospect, and the character of David Holzman (admirably played by L. M. Kit Carson) distills the eager naiveté that accompanied the zest for technology, deliberate inarticulation and the mistrust of words, the vibes and the hoaxes and all the lighter put-ons of 1967.At the end, Holzman is bitterly disappointed that his movie and his camera have taught him nothing — least of all how to control his life. The picture reminds me of the late A. J. Liebling's recollection of being 23 in Paris, when he felt that his life hinged on an impossible decision. Meanwhile, he was writing a novel about a 23-year-old in Paris whose future hung upon an insoluble choice. When the character caught up with the day of his own life that he was describing, he couldn't finish the book. Jim McBride's movie evokes the spirit of Liebling's enormous laughter when he remarked that few diaries yield conclusions or solutions.",Review,By Nora Sayre,Archives,,[]

They would have 300,000 men in there within five years. When Ball himself made exactly the same point to Kennedy, the President laughed and said, “ ‘George, you're crazier than hell,” writes Halberstam.

Sci. 127"" (21 minutes) are defined less by a developed cinematic style than by compassion for the subjects.""Llanito"" is a sorrowful montage of scenes of Indian life in the tiny New Mexico town of that name. It is not an especially finished film, but perhaps Mr. Lyon does not mean it to be.A couple of Indian men, half-kidding, dance around a beer can in a back alley. We listen to another man boast to the camera about his prowess as a hunter, while his mother mutters that the only thing he is good at is drinking.Juxtaposed against these scenes are others set in a home for the retarded, where, among other things, we listen to a white teen-age boy, who speaks in a high falsetto voice, telling us about freedom, sin, the crucifixion of Christ and the creation of the world (""God made everything out of nothing"").Mr. Lyon's fondness for bizarre images is balanced by a kind of solemn respect for his subjects. This is particularly true in ""Soc. Sci. 127,"" about an eccentric, hard-drinking tattoo artist named Bill Sanders, who, while he works, rambles on about Vietnam, lesbians and the art of what he advertises as ""velvety tattoos.""The third film on the program, ""El Chivot"" (The Goat) is a series of free associations on the life of goat and Indian. It runs six long, pretentious minutes.Mr. Lyon's skills as a photographer are evident throughout but I had the feeling in each of the films that he was still searching his images to find out what they might mean. This is not quite good enough.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

Suspense Film Dramatizes Kennedy Assassination:The Cast,1973-11-08,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/08/archives/suspense-film-dramatizes-kennedy-assassinationthe-cast.html,article,"If disbelief is one of our healthiest national reflexes, at least it has been well exercised in the years between the Warren Report and the latest protestations about the nonbeing of those Presidential tapes. The only danger is that fact itself can be a victim of disbelief: Ugly news that happens to be true becomes easier to ignore, and good news gets rejected with a cackle.""Executive Action,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet, offers a tactful, low-key blend of fact and invention. The film makers do not insist that they have solved John Kennedy's murder; instead, they simply evoke what might have happened, according to various researchers, including Mark Lane.The result is a cool, skillful, occasionally confusing argument for conspiracy. Wealthy rightwingers (Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan) wanted Kennedy removed because he was going to sign the test-ban treaty, ""lead the black revolution"" and probably pull out of Vietnam. The last two points may give you the hiccups, but that is what these characters say.Like calm businessmen, they organize the event. While three talented marksmen rehearse by shooting at dummies in a car driven through the desert, the conspirators search for a nut to use as a patsy.Throughout the stress is on technology — even Oswald's name comes out of a computer. The movie follows the ""second Oswald"" theory, and this part of the plot is deftly constructed, as is the disappearance of the three marksmen, also the calculations to ""have the F.B.I. watching the C.I.A."" and vice versa, while relying on the inefficiency of the Secret Service.The conspirators are cleverly cloaked in the style of Camelot itself. Lancaster and Ryan appear as pensive, practical semi-academics, rationally planning an act as bloody as a small foreign invasion. (They admit that they sometimes ""sound like gods,"" since they are also planning the world's future — ""Well, somebody's got to do it."") Both have the confidence and the casual class that we recall in many Kennedy appointees. Lancaster, looking miraculously young, overdoes the ""sincerity"" at moments—an old habit of his. And there are too many shots of the conspirators smiling ironically at once another. But Ryan is wonderfully benign and wry, wisely underplaying where others might have gone all out for evil.However, it is far more painful to think of Ryan's death — a few weeks after this movie was finished — than Kennedy's. And that is the problem lurking in this movie. Television footage is used to paw at the public's sentiments; we see Kennedy smiling and golfing and kissing his children, as well as making speeches. But ""Executive Action"" is emotionally disconnected from history to the degree that those with an affection for suspense can enjoy the build-up of the plotting — even though we know how the assassination turned out.Despite the flags crawling down flagpoles and the drumbeats, a national trauma has become a competent thriller. And it is just as well. Reliving the shock of that killing would hardly benefit any kind of audience now.So whether you chime with this interpretation, or, like a few I know, decide to embrace all the conspiracy theories of the assassination, the movie is useful in rousing the questions once again. The film's sternest and strongest point is that only a crazed person acting on his own would have been acceptable to the American public — which, at that time, certainly did not want to believe in a conspiracy.",Review,By Nora Sayre,Archives,,[]

Clive Barnes: “The New York Shakespeare Festival's first play at the Vivian Beaumont Theater is the fourth play by David Rabe that Joseph Papp has produced, and it is also the first play by David Rabe that does not deal with Vietnam. The problem is to decide what it does deal with. It is possibly intended as a portrait of a young tramp as a neurotic. Its heroine is Chrissie, a gogo girl in Philadelphia, who dreams of—well, she seems to dream of very little really. The trouble with the play is that we are asked to spend three hours with Chrissie, and we really know no more about her at the end than we did at the beginning. It would have been quicker to send a telegram. Mr. Rabe was not helped at all by the production, which seemed to fasten on the weakest aspects of the play. The play is said to be directed by Mr. Papp, but, of course, as has been announced, Julie Bovasso was in charge until a few days ago. Still, as it is, Mr. Papp must take the rap. Let us hope that the Shakespeare Festival will have better luck next time.” For Walter Kerr, see Page 3.",Archives,,Archives,,[]

' I. F. Stone's Weekly' Is a Film Delight,1973-10-19,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/19/archives/i-f-stones-weekly-is-a-film-delight.html,article,"It's only 62 minutes long. It was photographed in black and white with a religious austerity. It has no theme music. It is a documentary, and its title sounds like something glimpsed on an index card at the Public Library.Yet Jerry Bruck Jr.'s ""I. F. Stone's Weekly,"" which opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room, is such a thorough delight it left me feeling the way other people said they felt after seeing ""The Sound of Music."" That is, quite high.I should admit that ""The Sound of Music"" depressed me. It evoked civilization's imminent collapse. It made me think of the Chinese Communists and suspect that they'd be taking us over sooner rather than later. What was the use of thought or reason? Our minds have already turned into mashed potatoes.Or have they?Not, I think, as long as Isadore Feinstein Stone is on the American scene, passionately exposing the fallacies, double-talk and ignorance of the various rascals in Government, elected, appointed or there simply because of being someone's friend.I. F. Stone, now 66, has been a maverick all his life, a Communist anarchist in his youth, once described as ""a strident voice of illiberalism"" by Spiro T. Agnew, and now self-defined as a counter-revolutionary.Through it all, he has been the ferocious conscience of American journalists and those American citizens who would listen to him in person or who subscribed to his newsletter, which he started in 1952 and finally folded in 1971, when he moved his often dumfounded prose to the New York Review of Books.""I. F. Stone's Weekly"" is no dopey paean to a great man. Supplemented by a modest, informative commentary spoken by Tom Wicker, the film presents Izzy Stone straight, with all his eccentricities and enthusiasms intact, in interviews, in public speeches and even walking down to the corner to stuff a week's issue into the post box.We listen to Izzy describe a hilarious early confrontation with the Atomic Energy Commission (about underground testing), requiring him to make a visit to some seismology experts in the Commerce Department's Coast and Geodetic Survey. ""They were so glad to see a reporter. I don't think they'd seen a reporter since there was a tremble from Mount Ararat, when Noah's Ark landed.""He describes the danger for Washington correspondents who become pals with statesmen (""You begin to understand there are certain things the public ought not to know""). He talks about his own lean years as a blacklisted reporter and the genesis of his weekly, through which he taught all the rest of us how to find stories within stories, through inconsistencies, through information inadvertently made public but unnoticed by other reporters.The film brilliantly succeeds in communicating Stone's near-obsessive interest in truth and his optimism. The war in Vietnam, he suggests, and the survival of the Vietnamese people through years of bombing have re-established ""the primacy of man in an age of technology.""Toward the end Stone tells a group of students: ""I really have so much fun I ought to be arrested."" There is more to that statement than sentimental fondness for his profession. A cub reporter, he says, may get so excited covering a big fire that he forgets that something really it burning.As Jerry Bruck Jr. is lucky to have a subject as dynamic as Stone, so is Stone lucky to have a young film maker as persistent and as obsessed, in his way, as Bruck. ""I.F. Stone's Weekly"" has been three years in the making, on a shoestring, and in bits and pieces. The result is a rare film, a fitting tribute to a man who never gives up.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

Screen: 'Death of a Jew':Farce on Israeli-Arab Espionage Opens The Cast,1973-01-18,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/18/archives/screen-death-of-a-jewfarce-on-israeliarab-espionage-opens-the-cast.html,article,"With a title like ""Death of a Jew,"" you almost don't need a movie. And in Denys de la Patalliere's ""Death of a Jew,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, you almost don't have one. What you do have is an incredible story, told in moving pictures, about a tender relationship between an old Arab police inspector (the late Akim Tamiroff) and a young Israeli spy (Assaf Dayan). The newspaper ads quote one critic as saying that the story ""can be appreciated by Arabs as well as Israelis."" And I am afraid that an ecumenism at just that level of naiveté, is what ""Death of a Jew"" is all about.Shimon, the Israeli spy, is captured deep inside some unidentified Arab country, and, to make him reveal his contacts he is turned over to the police. When all else fails, even the evil technology of the police chief (Jean Claudio: ""It's not a question of courage; it's a question of voltage."" Sneer.), the old inspector, Mehdaloun, gets his licks.Mehdaloun hopes to replace Shimon's silence with a gregarious will to live, and thus to talk (so as to stay alive); and to this end he sets about corrupting him with kindness. He plies Shimon with gifts; rooms him in his own apartment; takes him eating, drinking, whoring; and grows so fond of his enemy that he begins calling him ""my son.""It is all to no avail. Shimon remains tight as a clam. But, irony of ironies, Mehdaloun falls prey to his own scheme! And he is left at the last, entering his dotage, with a new gregarious will to live—not to mention extravagant tastes for room service, vodka straight and compliant Scandinavian blondes.All this is not quite as stupid as it may seem in the abstract. Anyplace but the Middle East (and perhaps North and South Vietnam) it might have furnished a movie plot. A friend, intelligent and much too kind, has suggested analogies all the way from Claude Berri's ""The Two of Us"" to Bergman's ""Persona."" Personally, I am put more in mind of certain Shirley Temple movies; but any plot idea that has floated so far must have some buoyancy to sustain it.Assaf Dayan and Akim Tamiroff have been highly engaging actors, but they are both pretty dreadful here. The film is in English, which Tamiroff speaks with a Yiddish accent (somewhat unsettling, under the circumstances), and which all the others speak as if they had learned it at school in France. Denys de la Patalliere, (""Taxi for Tobruk,"" ""Marco the Magnificent"") directs as if he hadn't learned anything at all. ""Death of a Jew"" is the kind of film that seems to advance from scene to scene not by any inner necessity, but rather because everybody at a particular time in a particular place finds himself at a loss for what to do next.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

Screen: Wives in 'Limbo':Robson Views P.O.W. Families at Festival,1973-01-27,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/27/archives/screen-wives-in-limborobson-views-pow-families-at-festival.html,article,"If it has nothing else — and Mark Robson's ""Limbo"" hasn't — you might at least expect topicality of a film about the problems facing wives of American servicemen who are either missing in action in Vietnam or prisoners of war. By using something less than the sheerest art, Robson manages to make this story (""torn from today's headlines,"" we are told) resemble any number of dreadful World War II tearjerkers.""Interestingly, however, ""Limbo"" does demonstrate the impotency of so much of the liberal opposition to the war that is now, apparently, coming to an end.Robson is, I take it, a liberal. He certainly was back in the late ninteen-forties when he directed such films as ""Champion"" and ""Home of The Brave.""In that optimistic time, political and social issues were clear cut. War against bigotry was simply an extension of the war against Hitler. It was cosily patriotic. The good, voting liberal had not yet had to wrestle with the unruly, rising consciousnesses of all sorts of impatient groups, with, for example, the new black philosophy that says to hell with integration, we'll do it by ourselves.A lot of liberals lost heart in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. It is not fun being ridiculed by the people you had always wanted to protect. Robson, for reasons of his own, has devoted most of his later career to big-budget nonsense on the order of ""Peyton Place,"" ""Von Ryan's Express"" and ""Valley of The Dolls."" Watching ""Limbo,"" you can speculate why.The mind that made it is, I suspect, outraged by the war but seems afraid to say so. It is as split in mood as a lot of other people may be split in their sympathies — feeling sorrow for the American P.O.W. fliers, yet overwhelmed by fury with those who continued to go on bombing missions.The liberals protested but mostly with a politeness born, I think, out of memories of World War II, and even Korea, when wars were declared and the stakes were easy to define. There is a similar liberal sort of politeness in 'Limbo,"" which is as obvious in its narrative structure and physical look as in anything that anyone says.The screenplay, by Joan Silver and James Bridges, set on an Air Force base in Florida, is about three wives who are three points of view, good, bad and all mixed-up.The good wife (Kathleen Nolan) is middle-aged, Catholic, the mother of four, faithful to her husband and angry about the war.The bad one (Katherine Justice) is rich, beautiful, Southern, an all-out patriot and so spoiled that she refuses to believe the eyewitness report of her husband's death.The confused one is Kate Jackson, married only two weeks before her husband's departure, and now hopelessly in love with a nice, honorable, out-of-work space technician.The situations are real enough, but Robson entombs them in a lot of bogus domestic complications, photographed and acted in a simplistic romantic style that denies any sense of real topicality and urgency. If Vietnam were a war like any other (which it is not), there might be a small point to this approach.Only occasionally does the film seem to be about a special, very confused moment in history, but Robson tends to flub these moments too, as in the sequence in which three American wives visit the North Vietnamese embassy in Paris. He opens the sequence with some nice old chop-chop music that 40 years ago used to identify a stock shot of wicked Shanghai.Robson's heart is in the right place, but his movie is unimaginative, phony and ineffectual. It opened yesterday at the Festival.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

'Lolly-Madonna' Appears on Screen,1973-02-22,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/22/archives/lollymadonna-appears-on-screen.html,article,"""Lolly-Madonna XXX"" is a disaster, but I can't tell whether it's because hillbillies make rotten metaphors or because Richard C. Sarafian has made a rotten movie. The film was photographed in the Tennessee hills, and its cast includes Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges, Season Hubley and a lot of other people who play characters with names like Laban and Pap and Ludie and Seb and Lolly-Madonna.Its high-minded intention: to demonstrate the futility of war in terms of a feud between the Feather family and the Gutshalls, which begins with some fussing over a piece of land and climaxes in the sort of fighting in which people really get their heads blown off. I assume Mr. Sarafian and his screenwriters thought they were making a film about Vietnam without making a film about Vietnam, which is the weasel way of dealing with Great Issues.Had the story about the Feathers and the Gutshalls any dramatic or emotional intensity of its own, it wouldn't be necessary to mention Vietnam. But ""Lolly-Madonna"" is so absolutely spineless, it can't even be consistent about its characters, some of whom come straight out of old Esquire cartoons and some of whom are apparently sophisticated enough to argue scruples vs. jrinciples. The result is what W. C. Fields, describing a particularly ghastly mixture of free lunch ingredients, once called a moulage.Mr. Sarafian, the director of ""The Vanishing Point"" and ""Man in the Wilderness,"" has done better things, as has the co-author, of the screenplay, Rodney Carr-Smith, who worked on ""Bartleby."" Perhaps the blame should be put on the editor—I don't know. I am sure, however, that ""Lolly-Madonna"" (which is a signature, not a film rating) opened yesterday at the 59th Street Twin East I Theater and it's indefensible on any level.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

In brief, the centuries‐old pattern of a world economically and technologically dominated by Western societies has been smashed to smithereens. The most dramatic development has been the rapid transformation of Japan's ruined, partly handicraft postwar economy into a giant, high‐technical economy. Even today, moreover, with the example of Japan dramatically there to alert us, few have noticed how often impressive results seem to ensue whenever any unit of Asian society ultimately rooted in the ancient Chinese culture begins to do business in a fully modern way. Yet that lesson is abundantly plain from the examples of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and formerly impoverished South Korea, and it should also become plain in South Vietnam, if the South Vietnamese ever get the chance to do business in comparative peace.",Archives,By Joseph Alsop,Archives,,[]

But could I correct a few matters before they get into the obituaries, about which I'm becoming increasingly sensitive? I did support George McGovern, morally, oratorically and even financially, to the bitter end. Not even George knows whether that helped or hurt. My wife had $1,800 in hand or in prospect when we were married. In those days, before Mr. Nixon's economists who view me with such doubt took charge of the dollar, $1,800 was something. But it was hardly a fortune. Since then our asset position has improved, but for an economist that should be elementary. I settled upon Gstaad as a place to write some 18 years ago, well before it became fashionable. Maybe that is why it became fashionable, but this seems unlikely. I'd like to think I didn't come all that recently to a decent break for women. Gloria Steinem might even confirm that I encouraged her. Mr. Okun, whom I had previously considered a nice but rather harmless man, says that I write popular fiction about economics. This I also would wish to deny. But I am troubled by his charge.

There's no time for any of this.""""Almost eight hours. Some people don't ever have eight hours.""And so together they begin to waste those eight hours hand and hand, strolling down the dark and deserted boulevards past all the tourist attractions of Paris. Pausing before Notre Dame she grows bitterly philosophical: ""By the time you get out, that may have become a parking edifice!"" But eventually they do get to bed, and, through a night of blurred-focus passion, they make love. And if she does not say ""I never knew it could be like this,"" it is perhaps only because she could never be heard over the welling up of the music — the music that follows them everywhere on plucked and bowed strings and sounds nothing like so much as total submission to the last three bars of the ""Summer of '42"" theme.They have come to Paris—he, she and the background music—from Marrakesh, and they are bound for New York. They are the central elements in Robert Wise's ""Two People,"" a very silly movie that opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater. He is Evan Bonner, high-principled Vietnam war deserter returning home to face the music (not this music, some other music). She is Deirdre McCluskey, high-fashion model and daughter of a West Virginia coal miner (what else?), returning home to her little illegitimate son, to at least $100,000 a year and to a life that has lost its meaning. Naturally, they fall in love.I am tempted to hang the movie with quotations from its dialogue — which would be unfair. It is really equally bad in all departments. It may even be most aggressively awful when its people stop talking and take the train from Marrakesh to Casablance or the plane from Casablanca to Paris (first class all the way) or just watch the streets from their hotel rooms. There has never been such appreciation for the poetry of Paris traffic patterns, and in general the esthetic program behind ""Two People"" seems to be: When in doubt, travel.Estelle Parsons plays a supporting role as a fashion editor accompanying Deirdre, and, though conventionally brittle, her performance comes closer to suggesting two sides to a person than does any other characterization, in the movie. As Deirdre, Lindsay Wagner, a newcomer, is pretty and solemn. But a tendency for her facial expressions to disintegrate into grimaces (perhaps occasioned by the lines she must speak) makes it difficult to accept her quality. Peter Fonda, as Evan Bonner, seems greatly withdrawn to some inward meditation—a strategy, I believe, not of performance but of self-defense.Separate units are credited with filming in North Africa, in Paris and in New York City. But ""Two People"" is remarkably of a piece—not with the consistency of a movie director like Robert Wise, but rather with the consistency of something cooked up from the same package of synthetic soup.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

'Gordon's War' Views Drug Scene,1973-08-10,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/10/archives/gordons-war-views-drug-scene.html,article,"In ""Gordon's War,"" four black veterans of Vietnam wage fierce personal battle, using Army tactics, against drug channelers in Harlem. What, indeed, could be more admirable? This is a worthy film, whose format and substance—a black theme dramatized, for practical, constructive purposes—remain exceeded by its goal.The picture is tough, fast, moves in a straight line with no sideline fiddling but with pungent humor and vividly jabs the crime-ridden underbelly of Harlem. The sharp direction of Ossie Davis catches the argot, the flavor and the sinister ambiance of the area. And Mr. Davis stages a wingding of a car-motorcycle chase near the end.But the picture is inconclusive, far from profound, and the urgency of the theme has been overly simplified to fit the action. Only in the first part of the script is there character probing, as Paul Winfield (of ""Sounder"") broods over the addiction of his dead wife and recruits his three pals for personal and moral vengeance. A real uptown dope purge, says somebody, ""would take an army.""These four—Carl Lee, David Dowling and Tony King are the others—do very well on their own. Fiercely, methodically, the good guys nail the bad guys, with comparative ease. No policeman or detective, black or white, ever appears. At the fade-out, which simply hangs in midair like a warning, four white business executives are lined up as the culprits. ""Gordon's War"" is well-fought but definitely not the drug war to end them all.",Review,,Archives,,[]

Whether it crippled the enemy's ability to take the country in the near future is quite a different question.",Archives,By Sydney H. Schanberg Special to The New York Times,Archives,,['Vietnam']
