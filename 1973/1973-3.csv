In brief, the centuries‐old pattern of a world economically and technologically dominated by Western societies has been smashed to smithereens. The most dramatic development has been the rapid transformation of Japan's ruined, partly handicraft postwar economy into a giant, high‐technical economy. Even today, moreover, with the example of Japan dramatically there to alert us, few have noticed how often impressive results seem to ensue whenever any unit of Asian society ultimately rooted in the ancient Chinese culture begins to do business in a fully modern way. Yet that lesson is abundantly plain from the examples of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and formerly impoverished South Korea, and it should also become plain in South Vietnam, if the South Vietnamese ever get the chance to do business in comparative peace.",Archives,By Joseph Alsop,Archives,,[]

Letters,1973-03-18,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/18/archives/letters-variations-on-an-economic-theme.html,article,"To the Editor: The mail has just brought me Mr. [Barnard] Collier's well‐colored portrait (“To tame the monster: A most Galbraithian economist,” Feb. 18), and I naturally wouldn't dream of deleting any of his warts. But could I correct a few matters before they get into the obituaries, about which I'm becoming increasingly sensitive? I did support George McGovern, morally, oratorically and even financially, to the bitter end. Not even George knows whether that helped or hurt. My wife had $1,800 in hand or in prospect when we were married. In those days, before Mr. Nixon's economists who view me with such doubt took charge of the dollar, $1,800 was something. But it was hardly a fortune. Since then our asset position has improved, but for an economist that should be elementary. I settled upon Gstaad as a place to write some 18 years ago, well before it became fashionable. Maybe that is why it became fashionable, but this seems unlikely. I'd like to think I didn't come all that recently to a decent break for women. Gloria Steinem might even confirm that I encouraged her. Mr. Okun, whom I had previously considered a nice but rather harmless man, says that I write popular fiction about economics. This I also would wish to deny. But I am troubled by his charge. Mr. Okun was one of those who principally helped L. B. J. disguise the fiscal effects of the Vietnam war, so on fiction he stands as an expert.",Archives,,Archives,,[]

There's no time for any of this.""""Almost eight hours. Some people don't ever have eight hours.""And so together they begin to waste those eight hours hand and hand, strolling down the dark and deserted boulevards past all the tourist attractions of Paris. Pausing before Notre Dame she grows bitterly philosophical: ""By the time you get out, that may have become a parking edifice!"" But eventually they do get to bed, and, through a night of blurred-focus passion, they make love. And if she does not say ""I never knew it could be like this,"" it is perhaps only because she could never be heard over the welling up of the music — the music that follows them everywhere on plucked and bowed strings and sounds nothing like so much as total submission to the last three bars of the ""Summer of '42"" theme.They have come to Paris—he, she and the background music—from Marrakesh, and they are bound for New York. They are the central elements in Robert Wise's ""Two People,"" a very silly movie that opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater. He is Evan Bonner, high-principled Vietnam war deserter returning home to face the music (not this music, some other music). She is Deirdre McCluskey, high-fashion model and daughter of a West Virginia coal miner (what else?), returning home to her little illegitimate son, to at least $100,000 a year and to a life that has lost its meaning. Naturally, they fall in love.I am tempted to hang the movie with quotations from its dialogue — which would be unfair. It is really equally bad in all departments. It may even be most aggressively awful when its people stop talking and take the train from Marrakesh to Casablance or the plane from Casablanca to Paris (first class all the way) or just watch the streets from their hotel rooms. There has never been such appreciation for the poetry of Paris traffic patterns, and in general the esthetic program behind ""Two People"" seems to be: When in doubt, travel.Estelle Parsons plays a supporting role as a fashion editor accompanying Deirdre, and, though conventionally brittle, her performance comes closer to suggesting two sides to a person than does any other characterization, in the movie. As Deirdre, Lindsay Wagner, a newcomer, is pretty and solemn. But a tendency for her facial expressions to disintegrate into grimaces (perhaps occasioned by the lines she must speak) makes it difficult to accept her quality. Peter Fonda, as Evan Bonner, seems greatly withdrawn to some inward meditation—a strategy, I believe, not of performance but of self-defense.Separate units are credited with filming in North Africa, in Paris and in New York City. But ""Two People"" is remarkably of a piece—not with the consistency of a movie director like Robert Wise, but rather with the consistency of something cooked up from the same package of synthetic soup.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
