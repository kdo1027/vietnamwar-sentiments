' Summer Soldiers' Studies War-Weary G.I. in Japan,1972-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/02/archives/summer-soldiers-studies-warweary-gi-in-japan.html,article,"""The summer soldier,"" wrote Tom Paine in 1776, and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.""The hero of ""Summer Soldiers,"" Hiroshi Teshigahara's new Japanese film, is an American G.I. named Jim, a dark-haired, sad-eyed, exhausted, young Vietnam veteran who, while on leave in Japan, tries to desert from the Army and winds up, weeks later, back where he started in a state of controlled despair.""Summer Soldiers"" is an intelligent, level-headed movie that refuses—bravely, I think—to deal in the sort of hysteria that denies the intention of other antiwar films. Mr. Teshigahara, the director whose ""Woman in the Dunes"" was seen here eight years ago, and John Nathan, the American who wrote the screenplay, have made an antiwar film thousands of miles from any battlefront, in terms of culture shocks, the psychology of loneliness and people working at cross-purposes with the best of intentions. Which may be why ""Summer Soldiers"" is more witty than moving, and less tragic than Jim's eventual fate would lead you to believe.The soldier is first taken in by a good-hearted, not particularly bright B-girl. ""You gonna give me a hard time?"" she says to cheer him up. He smiles, and she says it again and again and again, which are a few times too many. She, in turn, puts Jim in touch with the Deserters' Aid Committee, a group of liberal-to-radical Japanese do-gooders who ask Jim why he's deserted, then argue passionately among themselves about whether or not Jim's lack of ideology is important.""Summer Soldiers"" describes no special dramatic parabola. It moves horizontally, as Jim does, in one-night stands, from family to family, most of whom treat the soldier as an exotic object. Jim, played by Keith Sykes, remains almost as mysterious to us, essentially decent and mostly inarticulate, Mr. Teshigahara, however, has a lovely time studying the attitudes of what a Japanese radical manual (""How to Resist Arrest"") calls the ""host families.""The director has as much sympathy for these people when they are being silly or smug or insensitive as when they are being selfless and understanding. One of Jim's hosts attempts to teach him Japanese and is shocked when the American prefers to spend the night with the bar girl. The G.I. spends another night planted in front of the TV set watching a Japanese-dubbed Lucille Ball show. He can't understand a word, but the faces are as familiar as the intensity of the canned laughter.On still another night in another middle-class household, he plays a guitar and sings some songs he has written. Says the father: ""You could go on television as 'The Singing Deserter,' wearing dark glasses. You could give the money to The Movement."" ""Yes,"" says Jim, though he realizes he has no real interest in any movements.From time to time, Mr. Teshigahara cuts from the narrative to an interview with a Spanish-American deserter, Miguel (Greg Antonacci), who, unlike Jim, knows exactly what he's doing, which is preparing for revolution. Miguel jogs, he studies, he disciplines himself. ""Life is beautiful,"" he says in that glum way of someone trying to convince himself.These interludes are out of keeping with the rest of the film, which actually has less to do with specific issues than with loneliness of such desperate degree that it becomes a type of humiliation. Toward the end of the film, two Japanese school girls, members of The Movement, try to pick up the soldier in a bar in order to help him. He turns on them: ""What if I were just an ordinary guy? Would you be interested then?"" They wouldn't. It is not, perhaps, a fair question, but it makes one of the film's most sorrowful, even Buñuelian points: to recognize charity is to accept insult.""Summer Soldiers"" was shown last night at the New York Film Festival.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]

Finally he gave up altogether campaigning on the issues (which had admittedly grown very blurred and amorphous), and has now turned to a straight‐out personal assault on Mr. Nixon.

"Screen: 'You'll Like My Mother,' a Thriller, Opens",1972-10-21,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/21/archives/screen-youll-like-my-mother-a-thriller-opens.html,article,"""You'll Like My Mother,"" the ads tell you, is a thriller—as if with a title like that you needed to be told—and it is a thriller of a fairly conventional, comfortably old-fashioned sort.Filmed in the dead of winter in a marvelous old mansion with cluttered firelit rooms, carved wood staircases, a secret attic hideaway, an ancient family Bible in the library, a coach house full of carriages and sleighs, it all but immerses you in castoffs from a rich and deeply rooted past that most of us can only dream of remembering. It also fails as a movie, but not dishonorably, and not without scoring some local successes along the way.The heroine is the young, very pregnant widow of a flier killed in Vietnam, who goes to visit her husband's mother, whom she has never seen, on a call of obligatory sympathy. She gets a lessthan-cordial reception from the mother, and discovers a miserable simple-minded teen-age sister-in-law she never knew existed. But it is only when, faced with a deepening blizzard, she is forced to spend the night and realizes with sleepy horror that someone has drugged her bedtime cocoa, that she is in present danger — and from more than just a hardhearted mother-in-law.The story that follows is full of holes and not too full of surprises, and it is all developed in a screenplay that might most charitably be described as awkward. There is a schematic simplicity to the plot that feels more like television than the movies.But there is also a visual density that is genuinely cinematic and that makes location shooting (in a real turn-of-the-century mansion in Minnesota) seem worthwhile. And the almost complete absence of false leads and tricky terror tactics suggests the kind of ground-level faith in situations and events that is the beginning of true morality in the movies.Along with its several virtues of omission, ""You'll Like My Mother"" shares in the respect for character and performance typical in Lamont Johnson's movies ""(The McKenzie Break,"" ""The Groundstar Conspiracy,"" etc.)—of which this is, in my experience, the worst. Patty Duke is expressive and surprisingly restrained as the young widow who must keep her wits about her. As her mother-in-law, Rosemary Murphy portrays a somewhat attractive villainess with an intelligent competence that is probably the best thing in the film.But I especially admired a new, rather lovely actress named—too perfectly—Sian Barbara Allen, who plays the simple-minded girl with more direct sympathy and less nonsense than you might expect in a movie the aim of which is to scare you.""You'll Like My Mother"" opened yesterday at several local theaters.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]
