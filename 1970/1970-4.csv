"'Hi, Mom!' a Brian De Palma Satire",1970-04-28,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/28/archives/hi-mom-a-brian-de-palma-satire.html,article,"AMONG contemporary-urban-scene-movies (sub-genre, invasion-of-privacy) Brian De Palma's ""Hi, Mom!"" stands out for its wit, its ironic good humor, its multilevel sophistications, its technical ingenuity, its nervousness, and its very special ability to bring the sensibility of the suburbs to the sins of the inner city. With no recognizable landmark further north than Cooper Square, it nevertheless feels like Bronxville or the quieter stretches of the upper East Side.Not that it aspires to quietness or that it even for a second eschews relevancy. One major portion (for me, the best portion) depicts an all-black play production, ""Be Black, Baby,"" in which the cast, in white face, mingles with, steals from, and finally beats and rapes the white liberal audience. And the hero, a young Vietnam veteran, moves from filthy picture-taking to middle-class apartment house bombing, partly in an effort to achieve total involvement—which, in the terms of this film, seems necessarily to include a final solution.But the eager hero (Robert De Niro) and the over-eager heroine (Jennifer Salt, the major interest of the flashbacks in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" revealed as a fine comedienne here) are so clean-cut; the second leads, white and black, so epitomize attractive youth; and the supporting cast, as in many Brian De Palma movies, could so handsomely model a panoramic painting of the Rape of the Seven Sister Colleges; that an air of tasteful respectability pervades even the outrageous violence. As if they were making bombs on West 11th Street.""Hi, Mom!"" turns approximately every other current social misery to a comedy that is sometimes quite elabborately successful and sometimes only well intentioned. As in De Palma's previous ""Greetings,"" the humor, at its best, is understated but highly structured—so that you have to work a bit for your laughs. But ""Hi, Mom!"" is much sharper, crueler, funnier. Although it scatters some shots (often in a kind of fast-motion photography that seems an addiction of De Palma's) it pulls enough together to suggest some major insights, as it investigates the militarization and despoliation of Washington Square South.But it is the minor insights that most happily remain: the white black-power activist (Gerrit Graham) who for a second demurs before painting his body entirely black; the pornographic-movie impresario (Allen Garfield) who wants to make ""the first children's exploitation film—nothing dirty, nothing smutty;"" or the mere idea of the TV show that chronicles the opening night of ""Be Black, Baby!"" A production of National Intellectual Television, it is called ""N.I.T. Journal,"" which, (to my mind, comes under the category of what oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed.",Review,,Archives,,[]
