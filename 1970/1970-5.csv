If you can't quite bring into reasonable approximation the rhetoric of Mr. Nixon and the reality of Southeast Asia? If you choose three to five years in prison instead of killing Vietnamese? As Dr. Willard Gaylin says, “This was a politically volatile subject, war re sistance; in a soci ologically vulner able area, the prisons; conduct ed by a question ably respectable researcher, a psy choanalyst.” Wrong. At least on the last count: Kenneth Keniston, Robert Coles, Rob ert Jay Lifton and, of course, Erik Erikson stack up as a library that— for respectability, intelligence and pertinence—mazes most recent sociology look like comic books written by computers. Dr. Gaylin belongs on their shelf. At some length, over a con siderable period of time, he interviewed young men who refused induction into our armed services; who chose instead to go to jail. In the process, he learned a great deal not only about prisons and the draft, but also about himself. A significant “counter‐transference” occurred, leading him to ask crucial questions about psycho analytic theory and therapeutic practice, as well as the war.",Archives,By John Leonard,Archives,,['Vietnam']

IF and when the world ends, I wouldn't be at all surprised if there weren't at least two or three American movie companies willing to bid for the distri bution rights, on the outside chance that the cataclysm might turn out to be a good show, as well as something less than total. One of the most impressive things about the just‐ended 23d Inter national Cannes Film Festival was the apparent enthusiasm of American film people to merchandise national disas ter. Sometimes this was simply a coincidence, as when Stuart Hagmann's “The Strawberry Statement,” a drama of campus unrest that has a brutal police riot as its climax, was shown here the day after the news came in from Kent, Ohio. Sometimes it seemed more self‐conscious, more self‐serving. The direc tor of “Woodstock,” Michael Wadleigh, a handsome young man who wears his hair in a long, Christ‐like bob, and his associates passed out black arm bands at the screening of their film, which they an nounced was being dedicated to the four students “who were killed by U.S. troops while manifesting their oppo sition to the Vietnam and Cambodian wars.” Unfortu nately, this gesture, no mat ter how sincere, followed a lot of conventional, high pressure publicity organized on behalf of the film by War ner Brothers, the distributor, and thus suggested oppor tunism, at least to members of the press corps. Warners had celebrated the film's ap pearance here by, among other things, passing out “Wood stock” headbands and lapel pins (the sort of things that are printed to order on 42d Street), bringing in a couple of bus loads of American students from Aix‐en‐Pro vence to carry antiwar ban ners in a small “manifesta tion,” by staging a rock con cert on the beach and by throwing a hippie‐style party that had, I'm told; a couple of the most elegant of the local couturiers working overtime. “I think,” said one French producer, “that War ners did everything but plant a bomb in the festival palace.”",Archives,By Vincent CanBY,Archives,,[]

Screen: A Plastic Garden:Don Johnson Portrays 'Stanley Sweetheart',1970-05-27,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/27/archives/screen-a-plastic-gardendon-johnson-portrays-stanley-sweetheart.html,article,"Stanley Sweetheart, a junior at Columbia, lost his virginity at 16, wears his hair discreetly long and has the kind of trouble with girls that a liberated Henry Aldrich might have. After a very earnest campaign, he succeeds in deflowering one of Grosse Pointe's prettiest and dimmest candidates for higher education. Later, he himself is seduced by her ravenous, overweight roommate (while starring her in an underground movie called ""Masturbation""). Depending on the way you regard such things, Stanley finally hits bottom, or top, when he winds up in an East Village ménage à trois with two extremely cheerful (and flexible) Lesbians.Stanley is a role-player—basically innocent. ""The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart"" isn't.It peers and peeks more than any average Russ Meyer movie, and it talks dirtier than just about any commercial movie that I can remember. Its camera swings and there is a lot of rock music on the soundtrack. However, like so many other places of expensive, modish, retail merchandise, it remains calculatingly bland, with no more wit or point of view than ""Search for Tomorrow,"" although it occasionally takes a reproving, almost motherly look at the dirty dishes, the piled-up garbage and empty beer cans that litter Stanley's apartment.The film, which opened yesterday at the Paris Theater, was adapted for the screen by Robert T. Westbrook from his own quite funny, reportedly semi-autobiographical novel. Although the novel was not specifically dated in time, it was apparently meant to be more or less contemporary.The novel's Stanley is not a political animal (the book makes no attempt to cover the Columbia riots of 1968), but its Stanley is facing Vietnam and, in one of Stanley's nicest, Mittyesque moments, he commits himself to non-commitment by tearing up his draft card and sending it off to his draft board with a letter that starts: ""I've been watching your ugly, stupid viciousness on TV for long enough. . . .""In spite of the fact that the movie's Stanley goes to the real-life Columbia (the film was photographed entirely in New York), there is no draft and no Vietnam. There is only a terrible feeling of déjà vu about the life styles it does cover. Underground movies were funny about seven or eight years ago, and Don Johnson plays Stanley as if he were imitating Marlon Brando, who was imitable 20 years ago. Stanley's encounters with women seem not to be patterned on life as much as on movies like ""Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers."" Women rampant leave him exhausted, and exhaustion, more than anything else, is the basis of his sentimental education.Of the women in the film, two are memorable: Dianne Hull, who manages to act the role of a sweet, dull girl without ever being dull, and Holly Near, who plays a big fat girl with the unfinished facial features of an irritable 6-year-old and the sexual hungers of Catherine of Russia. The film is the first theatrical feature directed by Leonard Horn, who comes from television where, among other things, he directed segments of ""Mannix"" and ""Mission: Impossible."" He's been a bad boy and someone should take away his zoom lens.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
