"'Georgia, Georgia' Arrives at the Forum",1972-03-11,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/11/archives/georgia-georgia-arrives-at-the-forum.html,article,"Maya Angelou, the black-author-actress-singer-poet who is making her debut as a screenwriter, along with Diana Sands and the rest of the interracial cast of ""Georgia, Georgia,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum, cannot be faulted for lack of purpose and sincerity.They speak with passionate feeling about the stark state of blacks in a world of terrible misunderstanding and dissension. But their emotions are, sadly enough, too often projected in rhetoric and surface histrionics rather than drama.Miss Sands, in the role of an American pop singing star on a concert tour in Stockholm, is caught up in the genuine ecstacy of a love affair with a white, expatriate American photographer. She is also dependent on but dislikes her militantly black, mother-figure of a maid-companion and her homosexual, black manager. And she is constantly importuned by a group of black G.I. deserters from Vietnam who want her help in enlisting sympathy for them back home.These frighteningly real issues are couched in explicit, with-it dialogue, but they are for the most part merely stated, often stridently, and not resolved. Miss Angelou's unexpected, shocking climactic scene, involving Miss Sands and her companion, appears to be not so much of a resolution of the film or her tortured heroine's problems as simply a melodramatic device.Credit Miss Sands with a finely tuned performance as the troubled entertainer desperately seeking identity in her hectic surroundings. She may be, as one of the principals wrly says, a cool, superior type who has ""just about kicked the habit"" of being black.But she is also the lonely success who, detesting her companion, still needs in private her mammy-like lullabies and ministrations. And she is a woman suddenly and defiantly in love.Dirk Benedict, now on Broadway in ""Butterflies Are Free,"" makes his film debut with a sensitive, restrained performance as a young man in love. Minnie Gentry of Broadway's ""Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death"" is forcefully natural as the officious maid-companion consumed by hatred of whites.Along with other actual black deserters, Terry Whitmore, the G. I. subject of a 1969 documentary about his desertion, gives reality, though not much impact, to the proceedings. And Roger Furman, as the homosexual manager, gives a merely conventional performance.Stig Bjorkman, the film's young Swedish director, has competently kept the story and cast moving briskly against the colorful background of Stockholm, where the film was shot. But the basic, essentially important source material provided by Miss Angelou is too often simplistic and only occasionally memorable.",Review,A. H. WEILER,Archives,,[]
