Screen: 'Topics' Opens:Plight of Brazilian Poor Seen in Italian Film,1969-03-17,https://www.nytimes.com/1969/03/17/archives/screen-topics-opensplight-of-brazilian-poor-seen-in-italian-film.html,article,"GIANNI AMICO, the Italian writer-director whose first feature, ""Tropics,"" opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater after a single showing at last year's New York Film Festival, is obviously sensitive and angry. But he is callow at making his point about injustice. In focusing on the plight of the mass of Brazil's rootless poor, he illustrates poverty with poetic altruism but is, at best, simply confusing in his oblique preachments about man's inhumanity to man.He employs a fictional approach shot through with documentary-style information about Brazilian economic history (from the sugar cane industry of 16th-century Portuguese to the present, statistics on races and on rates of pay), as well as off-screen and direct screen narration. He takes an impoverished young couple and their two happy children from cattle-droving in north-eastern Brazil to Recife to São Paulo in a search for work. One is favorably reminded of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" during the first three-quarters of this trek.The faces of his principals—dour, tired and drained of emotion—resemble lost souls as they trudge along country roads, dig for crabs in the mud near Recife and finally take up the offer of a truck owner recruiting labor for construction work in São Paulo.Vaguely one is made aware that Mr. Amico is incensed at inequality. Volkswagen workers get $350 a month in Germany and only $80 in Brazil, his bulletins shout. The truck speeds from Recife to São Paulo along a road banked by signs extolling American gas, cars, tires and banks as well as Krupp and its products. The newspaper headlines report on Stokely Carmichael, the war in Vietnam and Detroit riots. The bulletins and narration, translated facilely from the Portuguese and Italian into English subtitles, also speak of the dearth of doctors and other facilities as well as of work.When the couple, played convincingly by Joel Barcelos and Janira Santiago, arrive in a São Paulo teeming with cars, with crowds that show the melting pot of races and colors, with tall buildings, nightclubs and fashion shows, Mr. Amico's point is not really made. The signs of wealth are there—the man is put to work on the Sao Paulo Hilton, his family is ensconced in a shantytown cubicle — but nothing is proved by the writer-director's interspersed propaganda except that it is obvious, shallow and largely ineffective.In taking his inarticulate family on a bleak, forbidding trek to seek substance and roots, the director often reminds us artistically and poignantly of our own migrant farm laborers. But Brazil's and the world's poor are served badly, if at all, by his quick, amateurish, surface implications of the powers behind all the inequality.",Review,By A. H. Weiler,Archives,,[]
