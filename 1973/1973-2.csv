Sarafian has made a rotten movie. The film was photographed in the Tennessee hills, and its cast includes Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges, Season Hubley and a lot of other people who play characters with names like Laban and Pap and Ludie and Seb and Lolly-Madonna.Its high-minded intention: to demonstrate the futility of war in terms of a feud between the Feather family and the Gutshalls, which begins with some fussing over a piece of land and climaxes in the sort of fighting in which people really get their heads blown off. I assume Mr. Sarafian and his screenwriters thought they were making a film about Vietnam without making a film about Vietnam, which is the weasel way of dealing with Great Issues.Had the story about the Feathers and the Gutshalls any dramatic or emotional intensity of its own, it wouldn't be necessary to mention Vietnam. But ""Lolly-Madonna"" is so absolutely spineless, it can't even be consistent about its characters, some of whom come straight out of old Esquire cartoons and some of whom are apparently sophisticated enough to argue scruples vs. jrinciples. The result is what W. C. Fields, describing a particularly ghastly mixture of free lunch ingredients, once called a moulage.Mr. Sarafian, the director of ""The Vanishing Point"" and ""Man in the Wilderness,"" has done better things, as has the co-author, of the screenplay, Rodney Carr-Smith, who worked on ""Bartleby."" Perhaps the blame should be put on the editor—I don't know. I am sure, however, that ""Lolly-Madonna"" (which is a signature, not a film rating) opened yesterday at the 59th Street Twin East I Theater and it's indefensible on any level.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
