'The Visitors' Portrays Ordeal of a Threatened G.I.,1972-02-03,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/03/archives/the-visitors-portrays-ordeal-of-a-threatened-gi.html,article,"Elia Kazan's ""The Visitors,"" written by his eldest son, Chris Kazan, and shot in 16-mm, entirely in and around the Kazan country home in Newton, Conn., concerns the ordeal of Bill Schmidt (James Woods), an ex-G.I. who, with Martha (Patricia Joyce), the unwed mother of his baby, is threatened for 16 hours by two former buddies against whom the G.I. brought evidence of war crimes during their tour of duty in Vietnam.In the course of a routine patrol, the two former soldiers, along with other members of their squad, had first raped a young Vietnamese girl, who might possibly have been a Vietcong sympathizer, and then bayoneted her to death.It is one of the oddities of ""The Visitors,"" which is otherwise not exactly shy of exposition, that although Schmidt remains a shadowy character, the very fact that he can't explain why he turned in his two friends is one of the most interesting and meaningful aspects of the movie. It's as if it had been an unconscious impulse, a dim vestige of the kind of honor that today is as practical as an appendix.""The Visitors"" is a far from great film. It insists on saying too much about large issues when it should keep quiet and it's ambiguous when one has a right to expect explicit answers. Yet it is an extremely moving film, partly, I think, because everything—from the physical production to the melodrama—is kept in small scale, as if not to get in the way of, or to confuse, its very legitimate expression of a major American sorrow.I must emphasize, however, that I find ""The Visitors"" moving not only because I happen to share the Kazans' political and moral concerns. As anyone who squirmed through the idiocies of ""Johnny Got His Gun"" knows, the sharing of such concerns can often be a fate worse than death. Chris Kazan's screenplay sometimes has all of the grace of the Dalton Trumbo non-classic, especially in speeches that persist in spelling out simplistic points that, with any luck, we've already gotten.""The Visitors,"" however, is very much an Elia Kazan film and he is still a first-rate director, particularly of actors, in this case of four new young actors who possess the mystery and self-assurance of much more experienced performers. Especially effective is Steve Rails-back as the more murderous of the two visitors, a young man who looks like the sort of a nice, clean-cut, small-town American boy who could eat a piece of apple pie with one hand and cut a friend's throat with the other. However, I also liked Chico Martinez as the other visitor and both Miss Joyce and Mr. Woods, whose performances — mannerisms, movements, ways of touching each other—must supply explanations that Chris Kazan was apparently too busy to develop.The nominal star of the film is Patrick McVey as Miss Joyce's novelist-father, and it may be that my reaction to him is as much influenced by the unpleasant character he plays as by his performance, which does seem a bit broad even for a football-loving whisky-guzzling, right-wing fool. Says Miss Joyce at one point: ""My mother couldn't stand him—and neither could his other two wives.""For the most part, the elder Kazan keeps ""The Visitors"" remarkably unfancy and untricky. There is one almost nostalgic moment that recalls Mr. Kazan's best work of the 1950's, when, as in certain scenes in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""On the Waterfront,"" he employs highly theatrical melodrama—in this case, a scene in which Miss Joyce allows herself to be sexually drawn to one of the terrifying visitors—in such a way that the theatricality becomes real dramatic substance, and not a substitution for it.""The Visitors,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, repeatedly reminded me of Sam Peckinpah's more flamboyant ""Straw Dogs,"" and although I don't think it ranks higher in any appreciable respect, I'd much rather argue about it—what's right with it as well as what's wrong with it.",Review,By Vincent Canby,Archives,,[]
