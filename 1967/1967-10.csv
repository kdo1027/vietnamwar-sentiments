Film Festival: A Polemic on Vietnam:French Picture Closes Lincoln Center Event Rich Against the Poor Is Major Theme,1967-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/1967/10/02/archives/film-festival-a-polemic-on-vietnamfrench-picture-closes-lincoln.html,article,"THE fifth New York Film Festival was brought to a noisy wind-up on Saturday night with the showing of a fierce, unmitigated propaganda picture—""Far From Vietnam.""It is a frantic and formless compilation of filmed material—newsreel footage, interviews, cinema verité reportage, put-downs of President Johnson with montage tricks—that carries the angry message that the war in Vietnam is a classic example of a war of the rich against the poor, and that it is being waged by the United States to ""demonstrate to the world that revolution is a dead end.""It says, in a succession of segments and assorted intercut sequences, that the military forces of this country are ruthlessly slaughtering helpless women and children in Vietnam, and that there is absolutely no moral reason or political justification for our being there. It includes a clearly sympathetic interview with Ho Chi Minh and another with Fidel Castro explaining why guerrilla warfare always wins.There is outright ridicule of Vice President Humphrey's tour of Europe last year and a thoroughly scurrilous garble of shots of General William C. Westmoreland speaking, as seen on a badly tuned color television set. There is also a lengthy and tedious dissertation by a French actor reviewing Herman Kahn's book, ""On Escalation,"" and a rambling talk by Jean-Luc Godard giving his feelings about the Vietnam situation, as he sedulously squints through the finder of a movie camera.But the most explosive footage in this hodgepodge, and the most ironic, whether it was meant to be or not, is a long segment showing in vivid close-ups the chanting marchers and the hooting spectators along the route during the hectic peace rally and parade that were put on by anti-Vietnam demonstrators here last spring. It is explosive because it visions passion and fanaticism in such lurid and insistent graphic terms, and it is ironic because it indicates so clearly the total intemperance and blathering of radicals on both sides.This film was assembled in Paris by Chris Marker, the French director, from segments turned over to him by Alain Resnais, William Klein, Joris Ivens, Agnes Varda, Claude Lelouch and Mr. Godard. Its costs, which have not been made public, were guaranteed by a French producer who backed Mr. Resnais' ""La Guerre Est Fini,"" according to Mr. Klein, who was in Philharmonic Hall on Saturday morning for a press screening of the film.",Review,By Bosley Crowther,Archives,,[]
