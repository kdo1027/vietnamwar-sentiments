The lonely voice of dissent,1973-04-01,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/01/archives/article-10-no-title-the-lonely-voice-of-dissent.html,article,"As Under Secretary of State during both the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, George W. Ball played a major role in shaping the nation's foreign policy. But with regard to Vietnam he often provided a lonely voice of dissent. David Halberstam, in his recently published book, “The Best and the Brightest” (Random House), deals at length with the role Ball played of arguing vigorously against the Government's policy while remaining in the Government. “When he read the [Gen. Maxwell D.] Taylor cables calling for a small, oh so small, commitment, 8,000 men, he immediately told [Presidential adviser McGeorge] Bundy and [Secretary of Defense Robert S.] McNamara that if they went ahead with the Taylor proposals, the commitment would not stay small. They would have 300,000 men in there within five years. When Ball himself made exactly the same point to Kennedy, the President laughed and said, “ ‘George, you're crazier than hell,” writes Halberstam. And Johnson would study a Ball antiescalation memo all night and then question him carefully, citing page and paragraph without looking at it: “George, here on Page 18...”",Archives,,Archives,,[]
