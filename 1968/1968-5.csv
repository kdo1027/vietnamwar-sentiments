' A Face of War' Offers Intimate Record of 97 Days With G.I.'s,1968-05-11,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/05/11/archives/a-face-of-war-offers-intimate-record-of-97-days-with-gis.html,article,"THE purity, simplicity and numbing power of ""A Face of War,"" a feature documentary of American combat troops in Vietnam, render it one of the most authentic, intimate and remarkable war records ever put on film. The picture that went on yesterday at the Greenwich and Cinema Studio Theaters is an extraordinary thing to see and, more so, to feel.To make it, the American director-producer, Eugene S. Jones, and three college technicians spent 97 days in 1966 with Mike Company, 3d Battalion of the 7th Marine Regiment.There is no narration, no musical score, no glimpse of the enemy, except for a few corpses, and no editing attempt to slant a preachment against anything other than the acute actuality caught by the camera and the sound track. As such, it is a sermon on human waste that draws the viewer into a void as objectively as any war movie ever made.Most of the time the camera rides the shoulders of the point squad of the company, half of whom were either killed or wounded during the filming. And the camera and the men themselves, in their cryptic utterances and facial reactions, tell the whole story, from the opening scene, when a hand loads a rifle, to the fadeout, when the silhouetted survivors trudge into a graying twilight.Even more than ""The Anderson Platoon,"" that excellent television documentary released for movie-theater showings, ""A Face of War"" conveys the tedium and apathy of warfare, alongside an almost methodical acceptance of sudden attack and death.Toward the middle, a grinning G.I., watching his buddies deliver a native baby, drawls: ""Got four of my own but this is the first, time I ever seen one come. Moments later, a big sergeant, holds another infant aloft and flashes a smile, surrounded by babbling natives.On the heels of this comes an abrupt bombing and the sight of the men in almost ritualistic frenzy, edging forward and tending their wounded. ""Please take me home!"" moans one youth, his leg in shreds, in the most significant line of the film.Other vignettes are also unforgettable, such as a spirited game of football in the mud and mire between pitched tents, where one lounging man listlessly switches a Hanoi radio station listing American wounded to a blaring ""Jingle Bells.""The viewer is there, helplessly, smack in the middle of it all, in one stealthy night patrol, another thunderous night battle punctuated with unintelligible shouts and cricket chirping, and one revealing scene when the squad evacuates some villagers by truck. ""C'mon, men,"" says a voice, ""let's get out and help them. There's some old people down there.""The picture has a brief postscript, set to a folk ballad about Vietnam, of live clips identifying the most familiar soldiers, only two of whom are over 21. The distributor of the film is Commonwealth United Entertainment. ""A Face of War"" is truly memorable.",Review,HOWARD THOMPSON,Archives,,[]
