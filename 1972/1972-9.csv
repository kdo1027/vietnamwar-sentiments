Screen: A Rootless Life:Film About Veterans Is At Neighborhoods,1972-09-09,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/09/archives/screen-a-rootless-lifefilm-about-veterans-is-at-neighborhoods.html,article,"Richard Compton's ""Welcome Home, Soldier Boys,"" which opened very modestly at neighborhood theaters yesterday, is a largely unsuccessful, occasionally grotesque, but by no means dishonorable attempt to deal with some of the texture of rootless American life at the present time.It goes wrong—quite dreadfully wrong—in its more mechanically spectacular moments. But it seems right when it is content to roam around the towns and highways of the West and Southwest, moving all but aimlessly toward what should have been a small-scale doom.The soldier boys in question are four veterans, Green Berets, who are discharged from the Army in Arkansas, jointly buy a big black second-hand Cadillac, and set off for California to start raising cattle on land that one of them is supposed to own, but that is in fact no more than a photograph on a picture postcard. Along the way they alternately victimize and are victimized.They pick up, use, and possibly kill a tough girl hitchhiker (they never bother to see what happens when she falls out of their speeding car). They visit one boy's home, and move on, growing more desperate, and poorer. Finally, out of money and out of gas, they erupt into violence—totally destroying a tiny New Mexico town that is all too obviously a surrogate Vietnamese village—and absurdly simplifying a movie that could have taken something better.Each of the boys has a certain edgy individuality, and their leader, Danny (Joe Don Baker) seems genuinely complex with his imposing slouch, his defiant eyes and mumbled speech. Indeed, I am not sure but that what impressed me most about him was my being unable to make out more than a third of his dialogue—and feeling that all that inarticulate talk was an expressive part of a characterization.But it is as a road movie that ""Welcome Home, Soldier Boys"" really comes into its own. Five minutes here, 10 minutes there, motel scenes at night, or driving through the early morning—scenes that don't finally co-here but that do stand out for a kind of lyricism and reticence and subtlety of observation. There is a quality of emptiness and random pathos to the film that is ultimately rather lovely, and that belongs as much to the spirit of American movie making as it does to the spirit of American life.This doesn't add up to a good movie, but it adds up to a sporadically interesting one—in which the failure of the whole is no measure of some of the parts.",Review,By Roger Greenspun,Archives,,[]

Mr. Perry, once the owner of 12 cars (including a pink Cadillac), and the employer of 16 Chinese serv ants, lost his riches in the early 1940's. In 1970 he filed a $3‐million suit against the Columbia Broadcasting Sys tem, the Xerox Corporation, 20th Century‐Fox and the Indiana Broadcasting Com pany, in connection with a 19,68 documentary film that characterized him, he said, as “the white man's Negro, the traditional lazy, stupid crap‐shooter, chicken‐stealing idiot.” Now that his suit has been blocked in Federal Court in Indianapolis, Mr. Perry who is 80 years old, has ap pealed at a news conference for public support. “I opened the door to the black men of America,” he said. “If I let this [suit] go, the same thing can happen to Sammy Davis Jr., Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier.”",Archives,James F.
