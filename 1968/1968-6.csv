Film: 'Far From Vietnam':Six Directors Join to Shape a Collage,1968-06-07,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/07/archives/film-far-from-vietnamsix-directors-join-to-shape-a-collage.html,article,"THE narration of ""Far From Vietnam"" is of such serene banality and ugliness that it might have been written by a misprogramed spokesman for the military-industrial complex. But if the narration were cut—and I seriously think it is impossible for anyone concerned with facts, or words or the war to sit through it—the result might be interesting, a kind of rambling partisan newsreel collage. The film represents a collaboration by six directors (Alain Resnais, Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, William Klein, Joris Ivens and Agnes Varda) who wanted to do a work of antiwar (or more accurately, anti-U.S. involvement in the Vietnamese war) propaganda, without spending much thought or effort on it.There is a fine short interview with Ho Chi Minh, in which he says Vietnam can wait as long as it takes, and an interview with Fidel Castro, in which he says that a guerilla war that has the support of the people is the only force stronger than the new technology. There is a very moving conversation between a Vietnamese lady living in Paris and Mrs. Norman Morrison, widow of the American Quaker who burned himself to death to protest the war; it becomes clear why this strange gesture of most extreme nonviolence meant a great deal in many lives.But there are so many easy ironies: A television commercial for Band-Aids juxtaposed with war scenes, with more television commercials in case anyone missed the point; a broken film from the defective camera of Michele Ray in Vietnam, with a suggestion that a broken film is what makes the best sort of statement about the war, ""the cry that [Miss Ray] would have wanted to utter""; a sneaking endorsement of violence in the name of peace, or race, or poverty, or powerlessness — or, in fact, anything that is not U.S. foreign policy.Shots of demonstrations in New York, in Paris, even clips of ""La Chinoise."" It is all too facile and slipshod and stereotyped—designed to enrage one cliché cast of mind against the Administration and another against the enragés. The movie has, in any case, been overtaken by events. The last thing we need now is political stereo-types in a rage. A broken film doesn't really make the best statement about anything. Or utter a cry.The movie, which opened yesterday for a one-week run at the New Yorker Theater, was shown at last year's New York Film Festival.",Review,By Renata Adler,Archives,,['Far From Vietnam (Movie)']

Screen: 'Green Berets' as Viewed by John Wayne:War Movie Arrives at the Warner Theater,1968-06-20,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/20/archives/screen-green-berets-as-viewed-by-john-waynewar-movie-arrives-at-the.html,article,"""THE GREEN BERETS"" is a film so unspeakable, so stupid, so rotten and false in every detail that it passes through being fun, through being funny, through being camp, through everything and becomes an invitation to grieve, not for our soldiers or for Vietnam (the film could not be more false or do a greater disservice to either of them) but for what has happened to the fantasy-making apparatus in this country. Simplicities of the right, simplicities of the left, but this one is beyond the possible. It is vile and insane. On top of that, it is dull.The film, directed by John Wayne and nominally based on a novel by Robin Moore, has no hero. It is vaguely about some Green Berets, led by John Wayne, trying to persuade Wayne's idea of a liberal journalist (David Janssen) that this war is a fine thing for Vietnam and for America. The movie has human props taken from every war film ever made: a parachute jump; an idea of Vietcong soldiers, in luxury, uniform, champagne and caviar, apparently based on the German high command; a little Asian orphan named Hamchunk, pronounced Hamchuck but more like Upchuck than anything; battle scenes somewhere between ""The Red Badge of Courage"" and ""The Dirty Dozen""; a pathetically dying dog.There is inadvertent humor: ""He's dying,"" a Negro medic says, thoughtfully spooning Jim Beam bourbon down the throat of an elderly Oriental. ""Poor old thing can't even keep his rice down any more."" What is clearly an Indian extra in a loincloth somehow straggles in among the montagnards. A Vietcong general is dragged from a bed of sin (which, through an indescribable inanity of the plot, the Green Berets have contrived for him) with his trousers on. He is subsequently drugged and yanked off into the sky on a string dangling from a helicopter. A Green Beret points out to the journalist some American-made punji sticks (the movie is obsessed with punji sticks): ""Yup,"" the Green Beret says, ""it's a little trick we learned from Charlie. But we don't dip them in the same stuff he does.""What the movie is into is another thing entirely. What is sick, what is an outrage and a travesty is that while it is meant to be an argument against war opposition—while it keeps reiterating its own line at every step, much as soap operas keep recapitulating their plots—it seems so totally impervious to any of the questions that it raises. It is so full of its own caricature of patriotism that it cannot even find the right things to falsify. No acting, no direction, no writing, no authenticity, of course. But it is worse. It is completely incommunicado, out of touch. It trips something that would outrage any human sensibility, like mines, at every step and staggers on.The first Green Beret comes on speaking German, to show his versatility in languages. When the VC have just been sprayed with flames, a Green Beret is asked about his apparent affinity for this kind of thing. ""When I was a kid,"" he says modestly, ""my dad gave me a chemistry set. And it got bigger than both of us."" When the VC, nonetheless, win the Special Forces camp in hand-to-hand combat, a soldier calls in air support. ""It'll only take a minute,"" he says, like a dentist, as the VC are mowed down from the air. The journalist, ""the former skeptic about the war,"" the press kit synopsis chooses to say at this point, ""leaves to write about the heroic exploits of the American and South Vietnamese forces.""The point is that Wayne is using spoken German, lunatic chemistry sets, machine killing of men who have won fairly hand-to-hand, without apparently noticing that this is not exactly the stuff of which heroic fantasies are made. This is crazy. If the left-wing extremist's nightmare of what we already are has become the right-wing extremist's ideal of what we ought to be we are in steeper trouble than anyone could have imagined. The movie opened yesterday at the Warner Theater.",Review,By Renata Adler,Archives,,[]
