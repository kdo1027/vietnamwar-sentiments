He is appalled at what he sees as the stupidity of the policies that have kept Vietnam a battleground and destroyed its people—their traditions and their countryside. Photographs like the above and on the cover of this issue are accompanied by a text and captions that further reveal his bitterness: “'Motivating’ the American soldier to fight was cause of great concern. One view was that they should be made to stay until the war was won. Considering what carnage was caused by somewhat lazy and good‐humored G.I.'s the Vietnamese people can only be thankful for their lack of ‘motivation.’ His observations and the conclusions he has reached are subjective where Miss FitzGerald's are objective, yet they are so similar to hers that “Vietnam Inc.” makes a logical companion volume to “Fire in the Lake.”",Archives,,Archives,,[]
