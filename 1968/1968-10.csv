Snow's Red China,1968-10-03,https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/03/archives/snows-red-china.html,article,"EDGAR SNOW, an enthusiast about Communist China, has put together some old film he took in China 30 years ago and some 1965 film in which he is often a principal figure as a welcome visitor to the country. This documentary-style, but not exactly documented, picture opened last, night at the Bleecker Street Cinema.Mr. Snow calls it ""The China Story: One-Fourth of Humanity."" A viewer who reads the papers about the Red Guards and the cultural revolution and so on may feel the subtitle should have been ""One-Fourth of the Story.""The impressive thing about the picture is the sense that a lot of people with good intentions and love of their country have worked fruitfully in field, factory and the arts, a one-sided picture but still a pleasure to contemplate. Of course, the terraced fields made in the Chinese hills at immense pain by a commune look as fine as, but not better, than similar fields made a few years earlier in the Judean hills by an Israeli kibbutz.Inspiring as such examples of Communist China's accomplishments are, the somewhat limited glimpses they give of the vastness of the country and its problems lead to questions. The picture is all as pretty as the color in the more recent footage, apparently the work of one Chu Kai-chu.Since Mr. Snow himself is in the 1965 footage as the foreign correspondent at work, a viewer wishes that he had done some hard probing. Talking to lovely working girls, Mao Tse-tung and similar representative Chinese, he asks smiling questions and receives graciously phrased propaganda.A girl commenting on shots of athletic feats by some of her colleagues says that the country has world records to its credit—unfairly ignored by the West—and that the athletes are good because they study the books of Mao Tse-tung.Mr. Snow's narration includes bits like the comment, after a scene proving that there are still some Christians in China, that the Chinese in general are impressed that Christian American bombs are falling on Vietnam. This, the comment goes on, makes the Chinese eager to join the militia.A glimpse of a mushroom cloud ascending after a Chinese atom bomb explosion is followed by a comment that Chou En-lai says all the bombs should be destroyed and nuclear energy used for peaceful purposes—and the camera switches to a handsome institutional home for older workers.Mr. Snow sounds out Mr. Mao as to who is really in charge, but the Chinese leader does not reply with anything newsworthy. Mr. Snow appears, on the whole, to have been Mr. Mao's friendly visitor in 1965 rather than an inquiring reporter.An accompanying ballet film, made by the Peking Film Studio in 1957, shows some very acrobatic warriors of olden times slicing away at one another. This delightful half-hour of dancing gives more of a representation of conflict, advance and retreat and historic outcome than Mr. Snow's documentary.",Review,HARRY GILROY,Archives,,[]
